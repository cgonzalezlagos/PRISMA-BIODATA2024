	abstract = {Citronella mucronata (C. mucronata), a tree species endemic to Chile, has become threatened in its natural habitat and is currently listed as vulnerable. Tree population parameters have deteriorated due to indiscriminate logging and other anthropogenic activities, warranting research on mass propagation as a means of recovery. This study, unprecedented for this native species, has developed a successful method for its micropropagation. The objective was to establish a protocol for in vitro propagation of C. mucronata to produce large quantities of high-quality seedlings in an accelerated plant acquisition process. The best results were achieved by growing explants on Murashige and Skoog (MS) basal culture medium supplemented with 4.44 μM 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) and 14.76 μM indole-3-butyric acid (IBA). Explant survival rate was 78 %, the average shoot length reached 3.2 cm, the number of lateral shoots was 3.9, and rooting rate was 60%. Furthermore, stimulation with red and blue light in a 1:2 ratio, supplemented with 14.76 μM IBA, improved the rooting rate to 93%. The survival rate of rooted explants reached 100% in the acclimatization stage when using peat and perlite substrate (1:1 v/v). © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Land snails are among Chile's least studied invertebrates. Their natural history and ecology are poorly studied, even when it comes to striking species such as the black snail Macrocyclis peruvianus. This large and easily recognizable species inhabits the forest floor of southern Chile; however, we do not know its eating habits. In this natural history note, we describe the first records of mycophagy in M. peruvianus in native Chilean forests. The records were obtained thanks to citizen science (iNaturalist, Instagram and Facebook), which provided a complete data set with habitat remarks. We registered 21 records of mycophagy, from which we identified three fungus species (Marasmiellus alliodorus, Aleurodiscus vitellinus and Grifola gargal) and five genera (Armillaria, Boletus, Mycena, Pholiota and Ramaria). Of the consumed fungi, 58.82% grew in coarse woody debris and 64.70% belong to the order Agaricales, followed by Boletales, Gomphales, Russulales and Polyporales. In addition, we described the first record of M. peruvianus feeding on the native land snail Plectostylus peruvianus. Coarse woody debris could be a key element for black snails because their frequent food – the Agaricales fungi species – grows on them. Finally, M. peruvianus feeding on other native land snails could be rare in the wild because they co-occur in the same distribution but in different microhabitats. © 2024 Ecological Society of Australia.},

Little is known about the true distribution and species diversity of these genera, especially the latter 3. We examined specimens of Antennurella, Similantennurella and Klinckowstroemiella collected from passalids from several entomological collections. We added Ecuador, French Guyana, Guatemala and Mexico to the distribution range of Similantennurella, Belize, Bolivia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Trinidad and Venezuela for Antenurella, and Bolivia, Ecuador, Honduras and Peru for Klinckowstroemiella. We report 8 new passalid host species previously unknown for these genera. Our study suggests a broad distribution range of the 3 genera, probably encompassing Mesoamerica and South America except Chile and Patagonia, where passalids are not found. Antennurella, Similantennurella and Klinckowstroemiella apparently occur primarily below 1500m altitude, while Klinckow-stroemia has been repeatedly found above this limit. All genera have been found mostly on large passalids (>22 mm, long). We also cite the family for the first time from El Salvador. © 2023, Les Amis d'Acarologia. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Stevenia deceptoria is a woodlouse-parasitizing fly species that has recently been introduced into South America and was until now known only in Argentina. In those countries it has invaded, this exotic fly prospers in cities because of the abundance of potential hosts in gardens and public parks. Here we show that S. deceptoria has been detected in urban ecosystems in the Metropolitan and Valparaíso Regions using citizen science and we describe its current range in the city and the degree of overlap between its range and that of its potential hosts. Records of both woodlouse-parasitizing flies and their hosts were obtained from two citizen science platforms: Facebook and iNaturalist. The extent of occurrence (EOO) and area of occupancy (AOO) were calculated for S. deceptoria and different woodlouse species. We assessed the advance of S. deceptoria into the city, comparing classic EOO and α-hull mode with a chi-squared test with Yates’ continuity correction. We found that S. deceptoria was widely distributed in the Metropolitan Region, with a significant expansion over time. Woodlouse species, although common in the city, are sparsely sampled and so their EOO and AOO are underestimated. Stevenia deceptoria had a medium to complete overlap in distribution with potential woodlice hosts. The rapid expansion of S. deceptoria is probably due to its native host invading the Metropolitan Region. It is therefore likely that this fly species will expand its current distribution to neighboring regions where exotic woodlouse species are present. © 2024 Korean Society of Applied Entomology},

They have also been highly valued by the population and defended by the community, especially in the face of alterations to their hydrological cycle and loss of surface area, giving rise to a strong and organized movement in defense of urban wetlands. At the same time, one of the most significant laws in environmental terms for Chile, considered one of the most neoliberal countries in the world, was being developed. The law for the protection of Urban Wetlands 21.202, enacted in 2020, aims to halt indiscriminate real estate development on wetlands and integrate them into city planning. From a scientific perspective, this chapter addresses the role of scientific evidence in achieving this law, presenting various case studies that allowed for a focus on sustainability and territorial planning in the law’s development. Nowadays, more than 10,000 ha of wetlands have been declared, presenting a significant opportunity for the development of green infrastructure projects and nature-based solutions. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

	abstract = {Aim: Trait-based approaches are powerful to examine the processes associated with biological invasions. Functional comparison among native and non-indigenous species (NIS) can notably infer whether novel assemblages result from neutral or niche-based assembly rules. Applying such a framework to biofouling communities, our study aimed to elucidate their distributions within two marine urban habitats (namely floating vs. nonfloating habitats). Location: Southeast Pacific—Central Chilean coastline. Methods: Here, we examined the distribution of 12 functional traits in fouling communities established on settlement plates, after 3 and 13 months of deployment in the two habitats and across ports in Central Chile. Based upon previously described differences of assemblages and NIS contribution across habitats, we hypothesized that nonindigenous, cryptogenic and native taxon pools would be functionally distinct (and trait biased), and that functional diversity and structure would vary across habitats and successional stages. Results: Our results show, as anticipated, that nonindigenous (13 taxa), cryptogenic (12) and native (18) taxon pools are functionally distinct, though overlapping in the trait space. Non-indigenous species are rather related to colonizing traits, while native species are more related to competitive traits. Only one widespread NIS was functionally similar to the late successional and most competitive native species, including taxa elsewhere invasives. Despite differences in taxonomic composition between habitats, we did not observe functional differences between them. In contrast, temporal variations across colonization stages were detected along with an increased contribution in large and long-lived taxa, together with site-specific trajectories. Main Conclusions: We conclude that the functional distinctness among nonindigenous, cryptogenic and native taxa occupying artificial habitats in ports reflects niche-based processes. Site-specific trajectories indicate that scale-dependent assembly processes, such as dispersal and species interactions, are at play. © 2023 The Authors.

The present work identified 5 types of traditional SSP, and 8 benefits were associated with them by sheep farmers. The forest patch system is the most widespread in farms. Sheep farms under agroecological management have had greater adoption of forest patch SSP in relation to those that are not agroecological.

	abstract = {Citizen science is a valuable tool for early detection, distribution, and spread of invasive alien species (IAS). Nevertheless, citizen science initiatives have several potential biases and may be complemented with long-term structured monitoring schemes. We analyzed the spatial–temporal dynamics of the invasion of Harmonia axyridis (Pallas) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) in Chile, based upon two citizen sciences databases (WEB and INAT) and one structured monitoring (SAG). We collected 8638 H. axyridis occurrences between 2009 and 2020. WEB had a higher number of records than SAG and INAT, and in all databases, the number of records has increased over time. The three databases showed that the invasion started in central Chile and then spread toward the north and south. The WEB and SAG recorded occurrences in the extreme north and south, whereas INAT concentrated all the occurrences in a more limited area, included in WEB and SAG. Both citizen science initiatives concentrated their records in areas of high human populations whereas SAG records had a more even distribution across regions. At 2020, WEB accounted for 55%, SAG 54%, and INAT 8% of the total area accumulated with H. axyridis, with only 16% of area shared among databases. WEB and INAT obtained most of their records in urban and industrial land cover types, while SAG records were more evenly represented in different land cover types. Our results confirm that combined methods, including citizen science initiatives, national surveillance system, and localized samplings, complement each other in providing knowledge to understand the patterns, processes, and consequences of this invasion. © 2022, Sociedade Entomológica do Brasil.},

The platform, built using open-access tools, shows for each species a file with a general description, photo gallery and georeferenced records. It is available to the public on the Internet through the link https://kataix.umag.cl/sibaysen/. There is a module for citizen participation that allows local communities to enter their own participatory records, which must be validated by specialists. The participatory process has been developed through various social innovation initiatives such as Hongusto and the Open Laboratory of Subantarctic Sciences, in which scientists and local communities have been involved. This article presents the process of generating this system to expand the knowledge and valuation of local biodiversity. © 2022 Los Autores.},

	abstract = {The color morphs in the upland goose, an endemic bird of Argentina and Chile, refer to variations in the plumage coloration in males, displaying either barred, white, or intermediate combinations of the two. These color variations can be influenced by environmental factors and, consequently, may be associated with specific geographical regions. The aim of this work was to determine the extent of upland goose color morphs during the breeding season and to identify potential environmental factors contributing to their differences. We compiled data from citizen science platforms and personal observations, identifying 880 records spanning from 2000 to 2023, covering the entire upland goose breeding area. Environmental variables, such as temperature, precipitation, and NDVI, and the maximum entropy modeling method were used to predict the distribution of different color morphs based on the occurrence data. upland goose color morphs were not uniformly distributed during the breeding season. The white morph occupied the broadest habitat suitability range, followed by the intermediate morph and, finally, by the barred morph, primarily found in the southern part of Tierra del Fuego and exhibiting allopatry with the white morph. Habitat suitability predictions suggest that barred and intermediate morphs occupy colder and more humid regions with higher precipitation compared to the white morph. These results are particularly valuable for this species given its “threatened” status in Argentina and its current global population showing a declining trend, as morphs may represent genetic variants with potential unique local adaptations and preserving this intraspecific variability is crucial for the species' conservation. © Deutsche Ornithologen-Gesellschaft e.V. 2024.},

Abandoned dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) and cats (Felis silvestris catus) pose conservation challenges for Chilean wildlife including the pampas cat (Leopardus colocolo) and the güiña (Leopardus guigna). We used camera trap data to investigate influences of natural and anthropogenic landscape features on spatiotemporal trends of these species. We also used co-occurrence modeling and kernel density estimation to investigate spatial and temporal patterns overlap of wildcats, free-ranging (FR) dogs, and FR-cats. FR-dogs showed the highest detection and site use probabilities, while güiñas had the lowest across 80 camera trap sites. Top models showed no spatial avoidance between species and co-occurrence of wildcats was positively influenced by forest habitat. However, FR-dogs negatively affected detection of wildcats. Ravines surrounded by forest positively influenced güiña and pampas cat detection probabilities when dominant species were not present. FR-dogs and wildcats had significantly different temporal activity patterns and low overlap coefficients, while wildcats and FR-cats showed high overlap in activity patterns. We suggest changing current policies to control domestic animals and strategic planning in agricultural areas of central Chile to better conserve native wildcat species. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {The present study constitutes a review of the scientific articles about animal welfare in terrestrial farmed animals, published in 19 countries of Latin America. The main objectives were to quantify and characterize articles produced between 1992 and 2021 in farm animals' welfare using “Web of Science [v.5.32]” and “CAB Abstracts” databases. A total of 663 articles were found for the period analyzed, which were mainly in English (87%). The countries with the most publications were Brazil (43%), México (25%), Chile (12%), Uruguay (10%), Colombia (4%) and Argentina (2%). Cattle was the farm species most considered in the publications (41%), and the studies addressed mostly the on-farm production stage (76%). There was a rapid increase in the number of articles published in the last 15 years, accounting for 95% of the publications. This could be related to the publication of welfare standards by the World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH) since 2005, the creation of the Collaborating Center for Animal Welfare and Sustainable Livestock Systems—Chile-Uruguay-México in 2009, a Regional Strategy of Animal Welfare prompted by the WOAH in 2012 and the inclusion of animal welfare in the veterinary curriculum. The fact that most articles were in English shows that Latin American researchers have somehow overcome the challenge of publishing in a non-native language and their research can be read/cited worldwide. However considerable gaps in scientific productivity were identified in comparison to European and North American countries. Scientific research concerning the livestock industry in Latin America faces new challenges arising from the need to move toward more sustainable production systems within the One Welfare and One Health frame.

	abstract = {Information from diversity inventories was used to study patterns of biodiversity and species distribution, to identify potential priority areas for conservation, and to guide future sampling efforts. In this context, we compiled information on non-volant small mammal communities from the high Andes (>2000 m). Here, we present an open source dataset containing information on diversity (species composition, number of individuals captured), inventory design (type of traps, sampling efforts), and environment (habitat) for both unpublished and published information. This study covers 630 mammalian communities, geographically distributed throughout the Andes in Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina, and Chile. We compiled a total of 26,412 individual records belonging to 240 species; the order with greatest number of records was Rodentia (n = 25,319, 96.06%), followed by Didelphimorphia (n = 373, 1.42%), Eulipotyphla (n = 358, 1.36%) and Paucituberculata, (n = 307, 1.16%). Andean non-volant small mammal communities harbor a range from 1 to 17 species, with 93.06% of sites being composed of one to five species, 27.78% of sites with species richness varying from 6 to 10 species, and 4.17% sites composed of more than 10 species. Multiple sampling methods were used to survey non-volant small mammals; the most representative methods were snap-traps and Sherman traps, or a combination of both, in more than 81% of the studies.

	abstract = {Bird community responses to local and landscape variables in the city of Santiago, Chile. Urbanization has transformed the landscape affecting ecosystems around the planet. To provide scientific evidence for the conservation of birds in urban environments, we evaluated bird community responses to local habitat and landscape variables in Santiago city, the capital of Chile. We evaluated 118 sites (1 km2 in size) distributed throughout the city, which varied in cover and aggregation of woody cover. At each site, we recorded birds and environmental variables at four sampling points during the breeding and non-breeding seasons. Using community indices (Shannon's diversity and Pielou's evenness), we quantified the effect of landscape variables (percent and aggregation of woody vegetation cover) on the bird community. Then, we identified bird guilds, categorized according to diet, foraging substrate, nest substrate and body size. Using canonical correspondence analyses, we observed relationships between bird guilds and environmental variables quantified at the local and landscape scales. We recorded 42 species of birds. We found more diverse and equitable bird communities the higher the cover and aggregation of woody vegetation in the landscape. Granivorous and ground foraging birds dominated the assemblage, being positively associated with the built environment. Vegetation cover at the local and landscape scale had positive effects on most of the identified guilds, including invertebrate-feeding birds, omnivores, carnivores, nectarivores, vegetation foragers, vegetation nesters, ground nesters, nest parasites, medium-sized, and very large birds. Our results show that the bird community responds to environmental variables at local and landscape scales. Greater vegetation cover in cities would contribute to greater diversity and evenness of the bird community, promoting the abundance of different guilds, including those sensitive to the built environment. © 2023, Asociacion Argentina de Ecologia.

	abstract = {Background: Irresponsible dog ownership in urban areas is a public health concern with significant implications for human, animal, and environmental welfare. Factors such as abandonment, variations in adoption, insufficient supervision, emerging identification initiatives, and collective feeding impact the growth of stray dog populations and the transmission of diseases. Developing a modeling tool to understand the dynamics of canine population growth and the effect of human behavior on this phenomenon is essential. Methods: An ordinary differential equation model was developed to depict the growth dynamics and movements of urban dog populations, distinguishing between those with owners (restricted and semi-restricted) and those without (stray and community dogs). Two equilibrium states of the system were analyzed: with and without the presence of individually owned dogs. An increase rate for the population of individually owned dogs was calculated, and a local sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the impact of parameters on the reduction of this population. Additionally, two global sensitivity analysis methods were used to evaluate the simultaneous influence of the parameters. Results: Findings indicate that system equilibrium depends on various dog categories. Although total eradication of stray and community dogs is unlikely, equilibrium levels are directly related to subpopulation growth rates, responsible ownership practices, and adoption and abandonment rates. The growth rates of the population of dogs without individual owners have a direct and proportional influence on their regulation, while adoption rates have an inverse and proportional effect. The study, through global sensitivity analysis, identifies key parameters for each dog subpopulation. For restricted dogs, environmental carrying capacity is the most variable factor; for semi-restricted dogs, awareness of responsible ownership is crucial. The abandonment of restricted dogs significantly impacts stray dog dynamics, while the transition from stray to community status is an important variable factor for community dogs. Conclusion: Addressing the situation of unowned dogs requires a collective effort to reduce risks associated with the spread of zoonotic diseases, environmental pollution, and biodiversity loss, thus contributing to public health and environmental conservation. © 2024},

	abstract = {Urbanization stands out as a significant anthropogenic factor, exerting selective pressures on ecosystems and biotic components. A notable outcome of urbanization is thermal heterogeneity where the emergence of Urban Heat Islands is characterized by elevated air and surface temperatures compared to adjacent rural areas. Investigating the influence of thermal heterogeneity on urban animals could offer insights into how temperature variations can lead to phenotypic shifts. Urban pigeons (Columba livia) serve as an excellent model for studying urban thermal effects, given the melanism variations, which are associated with the pleiotropy of the melanocortin system. To examine the development of physiological plasticity in response to urban thermal variations, we conducted a study on pigeons in Santiago, Chile, during the rainy season. We assessed the influence of habitat on physiological traits related to metabolism and antioxidant capacities, which are theoretically affected by feather coloration. Our findings reveal that variations in melanism significantly impact pigeon physiology, affecting both antioxidant capacities and the mitochondrial activity of red blood cells. It was found that higher urban temperatures, from both the current sampling month and the prior sampling month (from CRU TS dataset), were negatively and strongly associated with lower antioxidant and metabolic activities. This suggests that elevated urban temperatures likely benefit the energetic budgets of pigeon populations and mitigate the negative effects of oxidative metabolism, with differential effects depending on feather colorations. © 2023},

	abstract = {In this era of a global biodiversity crisis, vascular plants are facing unprecedented extinction rates. We conducted an assessment of the extinction risk of 32 species and 7 subspecies of Copiapoa, a genus endemic to Chile's fog-dependent coastal Atacama Desert. We applied the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List Categories and Criteria enhanced by expert insights and knowledge. Our primary aim was to analyze the impact of trade and poaching on their extinction risk. We employed machine learning models, including multinomial logistic regression (MLR), decision tree (DT), and random forest (RF), to analyze the relationships between conservation status and various factors. These factors encompassed trade and poaching activities, landscape condition, human footprint, monthly cloud frequency, and biological traits such as evolutionary distinctiveness and maximum diameter. Seven taxa had an area of occupancy (AOO) of <10 km2, 10 additional taxa had an AOO of <20 km2, and 16 taxa had an AOO of ≤100 km2. This reassessment exposed a critical level of extinction risk for the genus; 92% of the taxa were classified as threatened, 41% as critically endangered, 41% as endangered, and 10% as vulnerable. MLR, DT, and RF exhibited accuracies of 0.784, 0.730, and 0.598, respectively, and identified trade and poaching pressure and landscape condition as the primary drivers of extinction risk. Our assessment of Copiapoa showed trade, poaching, habitat degradation, and their synergic impacts as the main drivers of the genus’ extinction risk. Our results highlight the urgent need for nations to develop and enforce strategies to monitor and control trade and poaching pressure because these factors are crucial for the long-term persistence of desert plants. © 2024 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Wetlands play a significant role in preventing floods and providing access to nature in urban contexts, among many other benefits. However, in southern Chile, they have been severely threatened by an urban growth paradigm that has traditionally overlooked the valuable ecosystem services they provide. This has led to frequent flooding, water quality issues, and biodiversity loss in several urban areas within the region. Llanquihue, a small city in Los Lagos district with a rich wetland system, is no exception to these problems. The approach proposed by Patagua et al. (Ciudades Sensibles al Agua: Guía de Drenaje Urbano Sostenible para la Macrozona Sur de Chile [Water sensitive cities: a guide to sustainable urban drainage for the Southern Macrozone of Chile]. https://www.ciudades-sensibles-al-agua.cl/, 2021) is applied to Llanquihue as a case study to understand the wetlands’ current behavior within the urban drainage system and to explore possibilities in terms of water-sensitive urban design. To simulate the flooding patterns and the spatial dynamics of surface/subsurface flux exchanges, a coupled model was adopted. Results suggest that continuous and integrated surface-subsurface simulations might be a key tool for urban stormwater planning in cities characterized by its strong interaction with a shallow water table. Based on these model results, one Llanquihue’s critical flooding areas is further analyzed and green infrastructure solutions are explored, showing great potential to mitigate flooding. Therefore, from a water-sensitive urban design perspective, it is suggested that stormwater management in Llanquihue should focus on preserving and restoring natural wetlands, as well as on developing additional green-blue infrastructure. This approach is meant to enhance current hydrological functions through a sustainable drainage system, increasing urban resilience within a global change context. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

	abstract = {Background: Backyard swine farming is critical to generating subsistence and food security in rural and peri-urban households in several developing countries. The objective of this systematic review was to analyze the molecular and serological prevalence of influenza A virus (IAV) in backyard swine populations globally. Results: We identified 34 full-text research articles in NCBI-PubMed and Google Scholar databases that have reported IAV sero- and/or virological prevalence in backyard swine up to 11 July 2021. The highest number of studies were reported from Asia (n = 11) followed by North America (n = 10), South America (n = 6), Africa (n = 6), and Europe (n = 1). While the maximum number of studies (44.12%) reported human-to-swine transmission of IAV, swine-to-human (5.88%), poultry-to-swine (5.88%), and wild birds-to-swine (2.94%) transmissions were also reported. An overall higher IAV seroprevalence (18.28%) in backyard swine was detected compared to the virological prevalence (1.32%). The human-origin pandemic A(H1N1)pdm09 virus clade 1A.3.3.2 was the more frequently detected IAV subtype in virological studies (27.27%) than serological studies (18.92%). In addition, the avian-origin highly pathogenic H5N1 and H5N8 viruses were also detected, which further substantiated the evidence of avian–swine interactions in the backyards. Conclusion: Human–swine and avian–swine interactions in backyards may transmit IAV between species. Monitoring the circulation and evolution of IAV in backyard swine would help stakeholders make informed decisions to ensure sustainable backyard swine farming and public safety. © 2022, The Author(s).},

In this study, we report the presence of two invasive species, the poeciliid fish Poecilia reticulata and the gastropod Melanoides tuberculata, in three isolated springs from the coast of the Atacama Desert in Antofagasta city, northern Chile. Both species were identified through diagnostic morphological features and phylogenetic analysis. This is the first confirmed record of P. reticulata in natural ecosystems of Chile. The finding of M. tuberculata represents the first record of the species in the Antofagasta Region, and the third in the country. Considering the well-documented adverse effects of both species on invaded ecosystems and their high potential for spread, we recommend the prompt implementation of mitigation measures. These should focus on the direct mechanical removal of these species, given the relatively straightforward sampling process and the relatively small size of the springs. Such measures would significantly contribute to the preservation of native species, particularly those categorized as vulnerable. © 2024 The Royal Society of New Zealand.},

	abstract = {Enterobacterales of clinical importance for humans and domestic animals are now commonly detected among wildlife worldwide. However, few studies have investigated their prevalence among bats, particularly in bat species living near humans. In this study, we assessed the occurrence of Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing (ESBL) and carbapenemase-resistant (CR) Enterobacterales in rectal swabs of bats submitted to the Chilean national rabies surveillance program from 2021 to 2022. From the 307 swabs screened, 47 (15%) harboured cefotaxime-resistant Enterobacterales. Bats carrying these bacteria originated from 9 out of the 14 Chilean regions. Most positive samples were obtained from Tadarida brasiliensis (n = 42), but also Lasiurus varius, L. cinereus and Histiotus macrotus. No Enterobacterales were resistant to imipenem. All ESBL-Enterobacterales were confirmed as Rahnella aquatilis by MALDI-TOF. No other ESBL or CR Enterobacterales were detected. To our knowledge, this is the first screening of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in wild bats of Chile, showing the bat faecal carriage of R. aquatilis naturally resistant to cephalosporins, but also including acquired resistance to important antibiotics for public health such as amoxicillin with clavulanic acid. Our results suggest unknown selective pressures on R. aquatilis, but low or no carriage of ESBL or CR Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. Future studies should assess the zoonotic and environmental implications of R. aquatilis, which are likely present in the guano left by bats roosting in human infrastructures. © 2023 The Authors.},

	abstract = {The humpback whale (Megaptera novaean-gliae) is a species with cosmopolitan distribution (Clapham & Mead, 1999); within the large population of the North Pacific Ocean, five Distinct Population Segments (DPSs) have been recognized (Bettridge et al., 2015). Individuals belonging to at least two DPSs (Mexican and Central American) feed from Alaska to California in June through October and then migrate to the coastal waters of Mexico and Central America in October through May to breed (Acevedo & Smultea, 1995; Urbán et al., 2000; Calambokidis et al., 2001, 2008; Alava et al., 2012; Bettridge et al., 2015; Figure 1). Meanwhile, humpback whales from the Southeast Pacific (SEP) DPS feed in waters off southern Chile and Patagonia and in waters surrounding the Antarctic Peninsula; they arrive at breeding grounds between May and December in coastal waters from Peru to Costa Rica (International Whaling Commission [IWC], 1998; Scheidat et al., 2000; Alava et al., 2012; Bettridge et al., 2015; Acevedo et al., 2017; Avila et al., 2020; Figure 1). Therefore, Central American coastal waters represent the potential range limit for different humpback populations/DPSs and correspond to an overlapping region for humpback whales distributed in the Northeast Pacific (NEP) and SEP (Acevedo & Smultea, 1995; Flórez-González et al., 1998; Calambokidis et al., 2001, 2008; Bettridge et al., 2015; Guzmán et al., 2015; Acevedo et al., 2017; Figure 1). However,individual whales can disperse beyond these “recognized” wintering ranges—for example, at least 33 humpback whale sightings were recorded between 2015 and 2018 in Nicaraguan waters belonging to the SEP, including some individuals observed in Antarctic feeding grounds (De Weerdt et al., 2020). © 2023,International journal of online and biomedical engineering.

Quantification of chemical species (OC, EC, metals, and PAHs) was done at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University, USA. Modern carbon in OC and EC analysis showed that the principal source of PM2.5 emission in Coyhaique was firewood burning compared with Independencia. The total PAHs and B[a]P concentrations were 6.3 and 8.9 times higher in Coyhaique than in Independencia. In contrast, As and Pb levels were significantly greater in Independencia. The HI was 14.5 and 2.37 times the limit considered acceptable (HI > 1) in Coyhaique and Independencia, explained 92.45% by B[a]P and 66.99% by As, respectively. CRI exceeded the threshold (1 × 10–6 ) in Coyhaique and Independencia, explained by As (75.38%) plus B[a]P (20.30%) and As (97.01%). The attributable fraction (AF) of deaths due to lung cancer from long-term exposure to PM2.5 reached 54% (95% CI: 25–72) in Coyhaique vs. 43% (95% CI: 19–46) in Independencia. The AF for cardiopulmonary cancer were 40% (95% CI: 17–57) and 32% (95% CI: 12–46), respectively. A relevant fraction of the cancer cases and potential expected adverse effects would be attributable to long-term exposure to PM2.5 and the presence of chemical compounds bound to the particles. These results deserve further study to help guide policy in different environments, mainly carcinogenic PM2.5-bound toxic species from other emission sources, particularly firewood burning. © The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Wetlands are environments with a high diversity and global importance due to the ecosystem services they provide. In Chile, most wetlands are threatened, including their avifauna, especially the two southern hemisphere swans (Coscoroba coscoroba and Cygnus melancoryphus). Here, we made three years of monitoring of abundance of both species in the Petrel wetland. Our results show that the Petrel wetland is an important site for the conservation of South American swan populations, with an abundance average of 38.5 ± 18.8 individuals of C. coscoroba (peak of 60 ind.) and 11.6 ± 12.4 individuals of C. melancoryphus (peak of 40 ind.). These swan species avoid sites close to urban areas and show a preference for habitats distant from anthropogenic activities. The detection probability of swans was influenced by minimum and maximum temperature and wind speed. The vegetation aquatic and riverine are key variables to the abundance of these swans. Our large monitoring highlights the importance of Petrel wetland for the conservation of southern swans and provide value information about their abundance patterns and the population dynamics of C. coscoroba and C. melancoryphus. These data support the need to develop conservation and management plans for this wetland. © 2023 The author(s).},

	abstract = {Urban green spaces provide natural habitat for birds in urban landscapes, yet the effects of noise and surrounding urban morphology on bird community structure and distribution are not well understood in Latin America, the second most urbanized region in the world. Santiago of Chile is the single city belonging to the Mediterranean ecosystem in South America and is subject to extensive urbanization as seen throughout Latin America. We examined the role of 65 urban green spaces—6 large urban parks (PAR) and 59 small green spaces (SGS)—in harboring native birds during winter 2019, analyzing the quality of green areas in terms of vegetation (i.e. NDVI, native vegetation, and tree cover), exotic bird species, noise levels, and surrounding urban morphology (i.e. building height and cover). Significantly higher noise levels were detected in SGS, along with significantly greater exotic bird (n = 4) richness and abundance than PAR, which possessed significantly greater native bird (n = 25) richness and abundance. Native birds were more abundant than exotic birds in green spaces with average noise levels < 52 dB and average NDVI > 0.5. Occupancy models indicate that green space occupancy by 50% of modeled native bird species was influenced by maximum noise levels, playing a larger role than vegetation (30%) and urban morphology (0%). We stress the importance of developing networks of large green spaces in rapidly urbanizing regions, with abundant tree cover, surrounded by smaller urban morphology, and regulating noise levels to ensure the conservation of native bird communities in cities, particularly those that are threatened. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Introduction: Flower flies (Diptera: Syrphidae; also known as hoverflies) are important pollinators of wild and cultivated plants. Other pollinators such as bees have declined, and many flower flies in Europe and Chile have been documented to be threatened with extinction. The status of other flower fly faunas is currently unknown. Aims/Methods: We assessed the rangewide conservation status of flower flies that occur in Northeastern North America where there is a diverse fauna of 323 native species. Over 150,000 records, drawn from a locality database compiled for a recently published field guide, additional museum records, recent field surveys, and citizen science records, informed the assessments. Results: We found that a minimum of 11 species are at risk of rangewide extinction, 267 have lower extinction risk, and 45 had insufficient data to assess. Our best estimate is that 4.0% of species are at risk, assuming data-insufficient species are at risk at the same rate as data sufficient species. The range for this estimate is 3.4–17.3% at risk, assuming that none or all data-insufficient species are at risk, respectively. Discussion: Factors causing extinction risk in the fauna we studied are poorly known, although habitat destruction likely explains the decline in one species. While at-risk species mostly have saprophagus or brood parasitic larvae, trophic relationships are confounded by phylogeny (the subfamilies Eristalinae and Microdontinae account for most saprophagus or brood parasitic species). The broad geographical ranges of most species likely contributed to the low rate of imperilment. Implications for insect conservation: The small percentage of at-risk flower flies in northeastern North America bodes well for the health of ecosystems there. The results contrast with the situation in Europe, underscoring geographic heterogeneity in flower fly conservation status. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Understanding how social and environmental factors influence biodiversity can contribute to sustainable development and promote environmental justice in cities. This knowledge is especially important in developing countries with strong social and environmental inequalities. This study investigates native bird diversity in relation to the socioeconomic level of neighborhoods, their plant cover, and the abundance of free-roaming cats and dogs in a Latin American city. Two causal hypotheses were tested: 1) socioeconomic level (defined by education and income) influence native bird diversity indirectly, as an effect mediated by plant cover, as well as directly; 2) in addition, socioeconomic conditions also influence free-roaming cats and dogs which could affect native bird diversity. To test these hypotheses, data were collected at 120 sites located in neighborhoods of different socioeconomic levels across the city of Santiago de Chile and fit to Structural Equation Models. Evidence supported the second hypothesis: in wealthier neighborhoods there was greater plant cover that, in turn, positively influenced native bird diversity; in addition, fewer free-roaming cats and dogs were found in these neighborhoods but they had no effect on native bird diversity. Results suggest that increasing plant cover, especially in more socioeconomically vulnerable neighborhoods, would contribute to urban environmental justice and more equitable opportunities to access native bird diversity. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The decapod fauna on intertidal shores in northern Chile is characterized by its relatively high diversity and abundance due to the presence of continuous upwelling by the Humboldt Current, which results in a high productivity. The decapod fauna on intertidal rocky shores is characterized by coexisting species that inhabits in natural shelters such as cracks and eroded rocks, as well as among macroalgae. We aimed to monitor the brachyuran and anomuran (porcellanid) crabs in three intertidal sites during two periods of time in September-December 2019 in the Antofagasta region, one site without human intervention and two sites in the city of Antofagasta, for which we applied null models in ecology. We assumed that the communities are random, a viewpoint that is more robust because it reduces the risk of error type I. The results of the application of null models on the co-occurrence species revealed that species associations are mainly structured for all sites, whereas the niche-sharing null model revealed that the reported species did not share ecological niches and in consequence there is not interspecific competition. The results would probably indicate that the species of intertidal decapods have a micro-specific ecological-niche differentiation, which would explain the existence of structured pattern in species associations. The results were compared with information for other sites along the continental Chilean coast. © The Author(s) 2023. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Crustacean Society.

	abstract = {Pollination is a key mutualistic interaction between animals and flowering plants, generating biodiversity and providing valuable ecosystem services. However, a pollination crisis occurs because anthropogenic disturbance affects pollinators and their habitats, risking biodiversity and food security. Also, the lack of evidence-based knowledge may worsen disturbance effects by delaying decision-making and conservation actions. Citizen science plays an important role in data gathering by engaging volunteers in obtaining such information. Here, we present the results of four years of pollinator occurrence data from a series of targeted BioBlitz events conducted each November from 2020 to 2023 in Chile. We obtained a total of 6327 records (identified to the species or genus level), corresponding to 569 species from 44 families, collected along the Chilean territory, a 10-fold increase compared to the pre-BioBlitz period (2016–2019). The most frequent species were the butterfly Vanessa carye, the invasive bees Bombus terrestris and Apis mellifera, and the native bumblebee Bombus dahlbomii. Despite inter-annual abundance fluctuations, species composition was similar over time. The most recorded families were Apidae, Syrphidade, Nymphalidae, and Buprestidae. This nationwide multi-year citizen science survey allowed us to collect an impressive dataset that would have been unattainable by scientists alone. Furthermore, we obtained valuable information for monitoring threatened (e.g., B. dahlbomii) or invasive species (e.g., B. terrestris) over space and time, aiding decision-making and conservation efforts. Engaging people in pollinator monitoring strengthens human-nature connections and fosters conservation attitudes. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Plant flammability research has proven pivotal in comprehending the contribution of vegetation to the flammability of forest ecosystems. Yet, the relationship between many leaf chemical traits and plant flammability is poorly understood. While terpenes and some leaf nutrients in plants have been extensively studied for their role in flammability, a wide array of other secondary metabolites remain unexplored in this context. Here, we present the volatile secondary metabolites composition of fresh leaves from nine dominant species from central Chile, both native and exotic, and determine whether there is variability within and among species in chemical composition and flammability. Moreover, we investigate how these compounds influence various leaf flammability traits. The Chilean Mediterranean ecosystem emerges as a useful study site given its unique endemic flora, increased frequency of forest fires, proliferation of invasive plants and extensive land conversion that favors the spread of fire-prone exotic species, and significant scarcity of phytochemical research dedicated to this ecosystem. A total of 118 volatile chemical compounds were quantified, belonging to over ten groups of volatile secondary metabolites. Terpenes, ketones, and hydrocarbons comprised 75 % of these compounds, and each species displayed a unique phytochemical profile. Surprisingly, some native species (Citronella mucronata, Cryptocarya alba) exhibited equivalent or higher leaf flammability than the well-known flammable exotics Eucalyptus globulus and Pinus radiata, respectively. Leaf flammability was best explained by the concentration of aldehydes, ketones, green leaf volatiles, and aromatic compounds. Interestingly, terpenes as well as moisture content were not significantly correlated with flammability. In conclusion, our results highlight the importance of considering a broader range of phytochemicals, beyond terpenes, to fully understand leaf flammability among species. Consequently, a deeper understanding -within and across ecosystems- of the influence exerted by diverse groups of phytochemicals on flammability is an urgent need for forest management planning in an increasingly flammable world. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Urban trees enhance biodiversity, provide ecosystem services, and improve quality of life in cities. Despite their benefits, trees are not distributed equitably, and many cities exhibit a “luxury effect”. Given the importance of public green space for providing access to urban tree benefits, we investigated the relationship between socioeconomic level and tree diversity and structure in 60 green areas in Santiago de Chile. Species richness and total tree abundance did not significantly vary among socioeconomic levels; however, a differential effect was found according to species origin. Introduced tree species exhibited similar abundance and species richness across socioeconomic levels, but native tree species were more abundant and richer in higher socioeconomic level areas compared to lower ones. Tree cover was higher in the high and medium socioeconomic level areas than in the low socioeconomic level area. A higher average DBH was found in the medium socioeconomic level area, which may be explained by older neighborhoods and a legacy of the luxury effect. Our findings reveal that socioeconomic groups are associated with differences in tree cover, width, and the number of native species in public green areas. Consequently, urban residents have different provisions of ecosystem services and opportunities to interact with natural heritage. Increasing the amount of tree cover and native species available to vulnerable groups will reduce disparities. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Lichens are significant components of the biological soil crust communities in gypsum ecosystems and are involved in several processes related to ecosystem functioning, such as water and nutrient cycles or protection against soil erosion. Although numerous studies centered on lichen taxonomy and ecology have been performed in these habitats, global information about lichen species from gypsum substrates or their distributional ranges at a global scale is lacking. Thus, we compiled a global data set of recorded lichen species growing on gypsum. This review is based on systematic searches in two bibliographic databases (Web of Science and the more specialized database Mattick's Literature Index) using various keywords related to the substrate or ecology (i.e., gypsum, gypsiferous, semiarid, saxicolous, terricolous). In addition, we revised lichen literature from countries with gypsum soils using Mattick's, Hamburg University's Worldwide checklist, and different national lichen checklists. Ultimately the review includes a total of 321 studies. This data set included 6114 specimen records belonging to 336 recorded lichen species from 26 countries throughout the world. The results showed large differences in the number of species recorded among countries, reflecting differences in the sampling effort. We provide a table with the number of studies and species in relation to gypsum surface in order to account for the bias produced by sampling effort. The number of studies carried out per country was not related to the gypsum surface but probably to other factors, such as accessibility to field sampling, economic or political factors, or the presence of a wider community of lichenologists. Thus, Spain and Germany hosted the highest number of recorded species (160 and 114 species, respectively). Outside the European continent, only a few countries had a large number of species: Morocco (46), United States (42), and Iran (37). Remarkably, countries from the southern hemisphere (i.e., Australia, Chile, Namibia, and South Africa) showed a low number of studies from gypsum lands, supporting the stated biases observed in sampling efforts among countries. Considering the most studied countries, the results show that Teloschistaceae was the most represented family in gypsum ecosystems followed by Verrucariaceae and Cladoniaceae. Regarding particular species, Psora decipiens and Squamarina lentigera were some of the most widespread and abundant species in these habitats. This data set constitutes a basic and first step toward a much more comprehensive database, to be periodically updated in future releases, which also serves to identify countries or territories where future studies should be accomplished.

	abstract = {The composition of the vascular flora in Punta Arenas city, found in the city’s public spaces, was studied. The species were identified and recorded in a database, which was supplemented with information on taxonomic classification, growth habit, Raunkiaer’s life form, origin status (native or exotic), and original continent-level distribution. These data were compared with studies conducted in five other cities in central Chile, together with an analysis of compositional similarity with these cities, by using the additive complement of Simpson’s index (1– βsim). In Punta Arenas, 119 species were identified, showing a higher proportion of Gymnosperms compared to central Chilean cities. The most represented families were Asteraceae (16 species), Fabaceae (14), Rosaceae (14), Poaceae (12), and Pinaceae (10), which together accounted for 55% of the floristic richness. The compositional similarity between Punta Arenas and the other central Chilean cities ranged from 0.187 to 0.315, showing lower similarity than expected by chance (Montecarlo randomization test; P < 0.05). The primary origin distribution of Punta Arenas’ vascular flora was European, unlike central Chilean cities where it was Asian. Finally, the proportion of exotic species (91.6%) and the number of exotic species per native species (16 exotics/native) were the highest documented for cities in Chile and higher than in other 114 cities worldwide. These results indicate that Punta Arenas’ urban flora differs from the flora in central Chilean cities, not only in taxonomic composition but also in growth habit, biogeographical origin, and high level of exoticism. These differences are likely due to the city’s territorial isolation and extreme southern location (53°S), leading to a unique urban flora configuration. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Urban infrastructures can provide ‘novel’ habitats for marine and terrestrial animals and plants, enhancing their ability to adapt to urban environments. In particular, coastal infrastructures characterized by a complex three-dimensional morphology, such as breakwaters, could provide species refuges and food. We investigated the role of breakwaters in providing habitat for vertebrates and plants, and the influence of anthropogenic litter in regulating the value of these structures as habitat. We sampled vertebrate and plant species and quantified the amount of anthropogenic litter on breakwaters and adjacent rocky habitats at several sites in three different countries (Italy, Spain and Chile). We found breakwaters to accumulate more litter items (e.g. especially plastics) than adjacent rocky habitats by means of their large-scale (i.e., 1 m) structural complexity. Birds, which used the artificial infrastructure as transitory habitat, reached similar abundances in breakwaters compared with adjacent rocky platforms. In contrast, synanthropic mammal species, such as Rattus norvegicus and feral cats, were slightly more frequent on breakwaters and appeared to use them as permanent habitat. Plants were frequent in the upper zone of breakwaters and, even though many macrophyte species can trap litter, their cover correlated negatively with anthropogenic litter density. Therefore, breakwaters provide either transitory or permanent habitats for different species, despite functioning as a sink for anthropogenic litter. Thus, new infrastructure should be designed with lower structural complexity in their supralittoral zone limiting the proliferation of synanthropic species. In addition, restricting public access to sensitive areas and enforcing littering fines could enhance the ecological value of these novel habitats by reducing the benefits to pest species. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {As climate change accelerates, so the need grows for green infrastructure that will contribute to the resilience and habitability of urban spaces. Coastal cities situated on river systems will be affected by decreasing rainfall, increasing temperatures, rising sea levels, and growing salinity of river water. These changes will alter wetland and river ecosystems, modify riverbanks and biodiversity, and affect local economies and ways of life. This work, which addresses the urban and suburban areas of the city of Valdivia in Chile, seeks to identify locations in which green infrastructure solutions would help to mitigate the effects of climate change. The work involved data collection and a multivariate analysis upon which it is based the construction of a series of maps intended for use as reference materials to support the formulation of adaptation strategies. It has been analyzed opportunities for reconciliation of urban green areas with elements of the local territory through the strengthening of natural systems.

Its introduction would be related to the import and transportation of aquatic plants. Here we update the distribution of P. acuta in Argentina based on a review of scientific collections, published works and new collections. Our review expands the distribution of the species from 11/23 Argentine provinces (until 2010) to 19/23, and we report the first record for the province of Santa Cruz, this being the southernmost site of the species. This new discovery in the province of Santa Cruz (Austral Patagonia), with an established and reproducing population in an urban area, poses a potential threat to local biodiversity (where there are no records of other non-native mollusks) and to human and animal health. This is due to the finding of populations in southern Argentina that are naturally infested by Fasciola hepatica. The record of P. acuta in aquatic environments of southern Patagonia makes it necessary to generate monitoring and control plans with the objective of identifying the dispersion vectors and preventing the spread of the species in other water bodies in the region. © 2024, Universidade de Sao Paulo.

	abstract = {The global increase in human population is driving a continuous conversion of land to anthropogenic uses. This is a major threat to lotic ecosystems worldwide, as it compromises the biotic integrity and health of rivers and streams. Studies in the northern hemisphere have shown that the effects of urbanization on fish assemblages include decrease and/or loss of diversity and abundance of native species, and a proliferation of tolerant exotic species. Such effects have not been widely studied in developing countries like Chile, where urbanization has impacted several river ecosystems. Over decades, the lower zone of the Andalién River in Central Chile has gone over intense non-planned urbanization stemming from the city of Concepción, leading to several physical alterations. The native fish and lamprey fauna of this coastal river basin has been reported as very diverse, with a total of 16 native species. However, this fauna has been affected by multiple effects of different land uses and direct alterations in the riverbed. To study how these fish and lamprey assemblages have changed, this paper compiles records from 1919 to 2018 and analyzes them in relation to the direct and indirect anthropogenic alterations in the basin. The results show a significant reduction in richness and abundance of native species, with only nine species currently. The two migratory lampreys, one of them endemic (Mordacia lapicida), have been extirpated from the Andalién River basin. Conversely, the richness and distribution of introduced species has increased throughout the river basin. The invasive species Gambusia holbrooki, first registered in 1999, is currently the most abundant in the urban zone of the river. Although the more substantial direct alterations of the riverbed occurred in the lower areas, a steeper reduction in native species richness occurred in the middle areas subjected to a long history of agricultural and forestry land use. We suggest the loss of resilience of the river ecosystem, and that the collapse of biodiversity in this river system demonstrates the lack of urban planning and the inefficiency of environmental regulations in protecting native species and ecosystems with high conservation value in Chile.

	abstract = {European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) were introduced ca. 40 years ago to South America, where they naturalized to central and northern Argentina, now reaching some neighboring countries. While Patagonia (southern Argentina and Chile) has remained free of European starlings (ES) in the past, they are now present along its northern boundary. Our objectives were to 1) investigate the factors explaining this recent invasion, and 2) predict how starlings might expand across southernmost America based on niche modeling using landform, land cover, and climatic variables representing conditions that may limit ES. Based on records from community science, informants, and our own observations, we conclude that two parallel processes generated new population nodes in northern Patagonia: 1) a southwards expansion from their core areas near the Atlantic coast (generating an incipient population node in NE Patagonia), and 2) birds released or escaped from captivity (generating an isolated population node in north-central Patagonia). Community science data was most useful from 2018 onwards, while data from informants was key to understand previous events (e.g., first ES confiscated from illegal trade in 2008; first free ranging ES seen in 2014). The most parsimonious model confirmed our prediction that human transformed lands in several portions within the target area are suitable for ES establishment, both in Chile and Argentina. Null suitability was modeled for the lands in southernmost Patagonia (all cover types). Desert lands (Patagonian steppe, Monte Desert, High Andes) that skirt the Andean temperate forests on the north, and most of the Andean forests, turned out to be unsuitable (especially with increasing latitude). Conversely, most of coastal Argentine Patagonia and the human-transformed lands of south-central Chile emerged as moderately suitable habitat for ES. Because the riverine areas under current ES colonization in northern Patagonia are fovourable for ES (i.e., agricultural and urban lands with abundant nesting sites), without control actions, this species might soon spread over ca. 5000 km2 around the Colorado and Negro rivers, affecting their agricultural industry. These rivers, which run west-east through desert lands unsuitable for ES, now represent corridors into south-Andean ecosystems, as they are surrounded by treed land (willows and poplars introduced from Europe) not originally available, connecting formerly separate ecoregions. In case ES manage to reach the eastern slopes of the Andes, they might cross to Chile through low elevation passes (<1000 masl) available south of ca. 38°S. The valleys of south-central Chile are both suitable habitat for ES and valuable productive lands that may be threatened by the invasion. We present management suggestions, and advocate for the development of a bi-national strategy to retard, prevent and alleviate the far-reaching impacts ES may exert on America's southernmost ecosystems and resources. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Although the abundance, survival, and pollination performance of honeybees are sensitive to changes in habitat and climate conditions, the processes by which these effects are transmitted to honey production and interact with beekeeping management are not completely understood. Climate change, habitat degradation, and beekeeping management affect honey yields, and may also interact among themselves resulting in indirect effects across spatial scales. We conducted a 2-year, multi-scale study on Chiloe Island (northern Patagonia), where we evaluated the most relevant environmental and management drivers of honey produced by stationary beekeepers. We found that the effects of microclimate, habitat, and management variables changed with the spatial scale. Among the environmental variables, minimum temperature, and cover of the invasive shrub, gorse (Ulex europaeus) had the strongest detrimental impacts on honey production at spatial scales finer than 4 km. Specialized beekeepers who adopted conventional beekeeping and had more mother colonies were more productive. Mean and minimum temperatures interacted with the percentage of mother colonies, urban cover, and beekeeping income. The gorse cover increased by the combination of high temperatures and the expansion of urban lands, while landscape attributes, such as Eucalyptus plantation cover, influenced beekeeping management. Results suggest that higher temperatures change the available forage or cause thermal stress to honeybees, while invasive shrubs are indicators of degraded habitats. Climate change and habitat degradation are two interrelated environmental phenomena whose effects on beekeeping can be mitigated through adaptive management and habitat restoration. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.},

	abstract = {We here describe Andean Condors’ (Vultur gryphus) use of the biggest landfill in Chile as a food source. We monitored the landfill between 2005 and 2022. Until 2013, there was an increase in the number of condors present in the landfill. Then the number decreased until 2016, coincident with an abundant food supply on a large spatial scale, due to high mortality of cattle that were affected by extreme drought and plentiful rabbit carcasses due to outbreaks of myxomatosis. The same temporal and numerical trends were observed in both sexes and all ages. Compared to published population parameters, in the landfill the proportion of immatures was higher and that of adult males was lower; therefore, the landfill could function as a subsidy mainly for the lower strata of the dominance hierarchy of this species. There was a strong seasonality, with a low presence of condors in the warm season and maximum numbers in the cold season, likely coinciding with seasonal movements of livestock between summer and winter range lands in the high mountains, resulting in lower food abundance for condors during the cold season. This is the first characterization of the use of a landfill by a high number of Andean Condors, use that could have implications for the species’ population in central Chile. Despite the apparent positive effect as a subsidy, waste disposals can have detrimental effects due to condors’ consumption of potentially dangerous compounds. This study underscores the opportunistic nature of the Andean Condor, a species that can take advantage of rubbish dumps. Long-term Andean Condor monitoring at landfills may serve as an indicator food supply over a large spatial scale, which should be considered in conservation strategies.

	abstract = {The sub-Antarctic ecoregion of Chile, which includes the administrative regions of Aysén and Magallanes, is characterized by its high degree of endemicity and the uniqueness of its species given its proximity to Antarctica. In particular, the sub-Antarctic channels and fjords, with more than 100 000 km of coastline and a complex geomorphology, is one of the largest estuarine zones in the world and harbors a high diversity of marine mammals that is in any case higher than the values recorded in more temperate areas of southern South America. However, biodiversity data records in this southern zone are still scarce and, when they do exist, they are published exclusively in specialized journals inaccessible to local communities. This lack of information hinders the design of conservation strategies on a regional scale and local socioeconomic development, such as the development of tourism specialized in whale watching or experiences similar to other regions of the southern cone. In this context and in order to visualize and integrate the existing records of marine mammals in information repositories, an exhaustive review of this group of organisms is proposed. A total of 484 records or sightings of marine mammals present in the Aysén region between 1852 and 2016 were compiled from bibliography published in specialized journals, books and technical documents. A total of 28 species, 6 belonging to the Order Carnivora (Families Mustelidae, Otariidae and Phocidae) and 22 to the Order Cetacea (Families Balaenidae, Balaenopteridae, Delphinidae, Hyperoodontidae, Phocoenidae and Physeteridae). This data collection began with the Biodiversity Information System for Aysén (SIB-Aysén) and continued with the Open Laboratory for Sub-Antarctic Sciences. Eventually it will be complemented with the observations of citizens associated with the SIB-Aysén. The relevance of integrating biodiversity datasets into open repositories as an essential tool for designing conservation policies and promoting, as far as possible, economic development initiatives based on knowledge of their natural heritage is discussed. © 2022 Asociacion Espanola de Ecologia Terrestre.

One of the control alternatives that has received much attention in recent years is the use of biological control agents, such as species of the Trichoderma genus. These microorganisms can produce enzymes, secondary metabolites and antibiotics that reduce and restrict the development of pathogens. In Chile, there are few studies on the etiology of Fusarium species affecting citrus and their biocontrol with microorganisms. For that reason, this study attempts to identify the species of Fusarium genus affecting orange trees in the central region of Chile and evaluate in vitro conditions the biocontrol potential of four fungicides based on Trichoderma spp. Therefore, from three orange commercial orchards of cultivars, ‘Lane late’ and ‘Fukumoto’, nine Fusarium isolates were characterized by the presence of beige, yellow, pink, purple and velvety to cottony textures. These isolates produced micro- and macroconidia with one to five septa organized in false heads. The in vitro antagonism tests showed an inhibition percentage between 36 and 54% of mycelial growth in Fusarium isolated when confronted with the four Trichoderma-based fungicides.

	abstract = {Due to the massive increase of the urban population, a global target is to achieve sustainable cities that are sensitive to nature and environmentally just for urban dwellers. To accomplish this, it is important to understand the responses of native and nonnative birds, identify the environmental variables that promote native species and limit nonnative species, and understand how they vary among socioeconomic groups. Although many cities in the Global South exhibit strong social and environmental segregation, few studies have investigated the relationship between socioeconomics and biodiversity. Therefore, to help promote ecological justice and biodiversity conservation in the developing world, we investigated the influence of socioeconomic level and woody cover on bird species richness and abundance in the city of Santiago de Chile. We also investigated whether bird response changes with species provenance—it is important to understand the response of native birds separately from nonnative birds because they imply opposite management strategies (e.g., conservation vs. species control/eradication). Thus, we surveyed 120 sites located in residential areas of high, medium, and low socioeconomic levels across the city and fit generalized linear (mixed) models that described bird species richness and abundance for total, native, and nonnative birds according to socioeconomic level and woody vegetation cover. We found that both socioeconomic level and woody vegetation cover influenced the bird community, but their effects changed with bird species origin, having opposite effects on native and nonnative birds. Residential areas where wealthier people live supported greater species richness and abundance of native birds than residential areas where people of lower socioeconomic status live. In contrast, residential areas where vulnerable people live had greater bird abundance that was mainly composed of nonnative birds. Therefore, affluent neighborhoods provide more opportunities to encounter native birds and experience nature close to home than poorer neighborhoods. Due to woody cover having positive effects on native birds and a negative influence on nonnative birds, increasing tree and shrub cover will contribute to supporting more native birds in residential areas deprived of woody vegetation, which are commonly low socioeconomic areas. Additional variables that can explain bird response among residential areas of different socioeconomic levels need to be investigated to better understand the factors influencing the distribution of birds in cities and promote a more biodiverse and environmentally just city. © 2024 by the authors.},

Moreover, OP is also believed to be a predictor of toxicity and hence the health effects of PM. This study evaluated the OP of PM10, PM2.5, and PM1.0 samples using dithiothreitol assays in two cities of Chile (Santiago and Chillán). The results showed that the OP was different between cities, PM size fractions, and seasons. Additionally, OP was strongly correlated with certain metals and meteorological variables. Higher mass-normalized OP was observed during cold periods in Chillán and warm periods in Santiago and was associated with PM2.5 and PM1. On the other hand, volume-normalized OP was higher during winter in both cities and for PM10. Additionally, we compared the OP values to the Air Quality Index (AQI) scale and found cases of days that were classified as having “good” air quality (supposed to be less harmful to health) showing extremely high OP values that were similar to those on days that were classified as “unhealthy”. Based on these results, we suggest using the OP as a complementary measure to the PM mass concentration because it includes important new information related to PM properties and compositions that could help improve current air quality management tools. © 2023 The Author(s)},

The aim of the present study was to determine the spatial distribution patterns of lower intertidal decapods on Pelluhuín beach, a small beach south of Puerto Montt, northern Patagonia. Data were obtained by counting individuals from random quadrants in intertidal zones; to the obtained data the variance/mean ratio was applied to determine if the specimens have a random, aggregate or uniform distribution, which are associated with Poisson, negative binomial or positive binomial distributions respectively. Among four of the species observed, a uniform distribution (positive binomial) was reported, and one had an aggregated pattern (negative binomial). The sites correspond to rocky shores in semi-urban zones, and in a protected zone. Our results on the interpretative probabilistic models of aggregated distribution patterns agree with previously reported observations of decapods on the rocky shores of Northern and Central Chile, specifically in interpretative probabilistic models. © PATRICIO DE LOS RIOS-ESCALANTE ET AL., 2024.},

	abstract = {The species of Gymnosomatini (Diptera: Tachinidae) are specialized to attack stink bugs (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae). Some of these flies, such as those in the genus Trichopoda Berthold, are conspicuous and represent target species to study with citizen science. Here we report for the first time the distribution range of T. (Galactomyia) pictipennis Bigot, a newly introduced biological control species of tachinid for use against stink bugs in Chile using data obtained through the citizen science method. Additionally, we update the distribution of T. arcuata (Bigot), a native biological control species of tachinid, and assess the grade of overlap between the flies and their main stink bug hosts. We obtained data regarding the occurrence of flies and stink bugs from the citizen science program “Moscas Florícolas de Chile,” from Facebook groups, and from iNaturalist. We standardized our data to avoid temporal, spatial, and geographic biases. We report the extent of occurrence (EOO) and area of occupancy (AOO) for each fly and stink bug species. The EOOs for T. pictipennis and T. arcuata are 85,474 km2 and 20,647 km2 through central Chile ecosystems, respectively. The EOO of T. arcuata is overlapped by 53% with the introduced species. Trichopoda pictipennis has a high percentage of overlap with the EOO of Nezara viridula Linnaeus (61%), whereas T. arcuata has low percentages of overlap with different native Acledra species and with N. viridula. We discuss the potential of citizen science to detect (1) areas with higher diversity or gaps of occurrences, (2) new biological control agents, (3) prey records, (4) negative impacts on non-target species, (5) changes in composition at long-term, and (6) areas to promote conservation biological control in agricultural landscapes. © 2022, Sociedade Entomológica do Brasil.},

	abstract = {Agricultural activities are a major cause of change in avifauna, frequently resulting in diminished diversity and biotic homogenization, and ultimately compromising ecosystem functioning and resilience. Arid ecosystems, which provide habitat for numerous native and endemic bird species, are vulnerable to global change and valuable in predicting future ecosystem shifts in regions undergoing aridification as a result of climate change. However, the impacts of agriculture on bird communities in arid ecosystems are understudied. Here, we evaluate these impacts in the arid Limarí watershed in north-central Chile, a region that has experienced extensive land use conversion to agriculture over the past 50 years. Specifically, we investigated current spatial patterns of avian beta diversity and the impact of landscape context on this diversity facet. Moreover, we evaluated how bird species respond to land cover and habitat conditions and the role of specific bird traits in this regard. To achieve this, we evaluated taxonomic and functional beta diversity across 26 sites distributed along a gradient of agricultural development, applied a beta diversity decomposition procedure, and carried out hierarchical joint species distribution modeling. Our study revealed high taxonomic but low functional beta diversity of the avifauna in the Limarí watershed, potentially indicative of past functional homogenization. Contrary to our initial expectations, present agricultural practices did not decrease beta diversity. While human-related landscape elements and agricultural features mostly had neutral or positive effects on bird occurrence, they negatively affected endemic species and certain bird traits related to diet and habitat. Riparian vegetation cover and quality, unrelated to agricultural and urban development, emerged as key factors structuring the regional bird community, and influenced beta diversity. Our results underscore the profound influence of land use change on the avian community in this arid region and the vital role of riparian ecosystems in this regard. Balancing conservation objectives with agricultural development is key to ensuring both the persistence of several functional groups in the region as well as the ecosystem services they provide. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

Much of the distributional information about this species is restricted to the Cape Horn islands, which have extreme environmental conditions, but the species' natural history, range limits, and habitat use have never been described or confirmed. Our goals were to describe the distributional limits of this sub-Antarctic fly with the help of citizen science and use this information type to describe this tachinid's habitat use and potential biological interactions with nonvascular and vascular flora. We found that citizen science significantly increased our understanding of the extent of occurrence, expanding the known distributional range by 195 km to the north and 153 km to the west. On the contrary, the values for the area of occupancy were not significant, but the occupancy overlap between different records was very low. We confirmed that H. clausa's habitat uses peatlands and although we have not provided evidence of pollination or movement of spores, we hypothesized, that the walking activity of H. clausa could help move sperm from mosses and pollen from the flowers of vascular plants, so they could act as potential pollinators. Citizen science can reduce and eliminate some scientific knowledge shortfalls and propose new ecological questions that could increase our knowledge of extreme ecosystems. © 2024 The Authors.

	abstract = {The global rise in companion animal populations, particularly dogs and cats, is driven by emotional and social benefits for owners, and their population management is becoming critically important to avoid a plethora of adverse effects on themselves, humans, and wildlife. We estimated the size and density of the owned canine and feline population in Chile and evaluated the status of microchipping, registration, sterilization rates, and the proportion of owned animals that roam unsupervised. A cross-sectional household survey in 36 districts was conducted and standard inferential statistics was employed to analyze differences between cats and dogs, sexes within each species, and between rural and urban areas. Additionally, two negative binomial models with mixed effects were developed to predict the number of dogs and cats per households. Two methods were used to compare population size estimates at the country level, multiplying: (1) the estimated mean number of companion animals per household by the estimated number of households at the country level, and (2) the estimated human:dog and human:cat ratios by the total human population. The study involved 6333 respondents, of which 76% (74% urban; 83% rural) owned companion animals (dogs and/or cats). Individuals in rural multi-person households increase the probability of owning dogs and/or cats. Additionally, women exhibit a greater inclination towards cat and dog ownership compared to men, while those over 30 years old demonstrate lower rates of companion animal ownership in contrast to the 18–30 age group for both species. The overall human:dog and human:cat ratios estimated were 2.7:1, and 6.2:1, respectively. The estimated total number of owned dogs and cats in Chile ranged from 9.6 to 10.7 million, depending on the methodological approach, while national median density of companion animals was 12 dogs per km2 (ranging from 0.02 to 7232) and 5 cats per km2 (ranging from 0.01 to 3242). This nationwide study showed one of the highest percentages of households with companion animals in Latin America and relatively low registration and sterilization rates, highlighting the need to strength long-term public policies to control populations of companion animals and promote responsibility in pet ownership. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Background and aims: The main goal of Protected Wild Areas (in spanish ASP) is to protect biodiversity. Limiting the entry of exotic species is an essential priority. The objective of this study was to register exotic plants species within Chile’s ASP and to describe floristic patterns which determine species presence and distribution. M&M: Information was collected across 35 ASP, and total number of flora species and the proportion of exotic plants were reported. Richness was obtained and an invasibility index calculated on each ASP. Species composition analysis and floristic patterns determination were carried out through statistical analyses of ordering, similarity and regression. Results: A total of 355 exotic plant species were recorded across the studied ASP. The Reserva Nacional Rio Clarillo had the greatest species richness, while the highest proportion and invasibility occurred in the Monumento Natural Cerro Ñielol. The distance to the nearest city, precipitation and temperature were the environmental variables with the highest incidence on the different assemblages of exotic species that exhibit ASP. Discussion: Exotic plants richness within ASP was high, in relation to the total adventitious flora that Chile presents. The evidence shown suggests a low proportion of exotic plants shared among the ASP distributed in the different bioclimates considered. These types of studies constitute the basis for the preparation of risk lists and the design of management programs for exotic plant species. © 2023, Boletin de la Sociedad Argentina de Botanica.

	abstract = {Monk Parakeets are considered one of the most invasive bird species given its unique capacity among psittacines to build their own communal nests. Originally introduced as pets in houses from where they escaped or were released, they are currently considered invasive in more than 20 countries worldwide. This is the case in Chile, where Monk Parakeets were introduced during the 1970s. Between 2016 and 2019 we searched Monk Parakeets’ nests structures in the Santiago metropolis region. We identified 1458 Monk Parakeets’ communal nests on 546 trees belonging to 34 tree species. Ninety-one percent of the occupied trees were also introduced. Paraná pine and cedar of Lebanon were the tree species with highest abundance of nests, averaging more than four nests/tree/species, with 23 and 18 maximum number of nests, respectively. Tasmanian blue gum and black locust were selected by parakeets more often than expected, based on availability. From all trees, 24.6% denoted health problems and 47.3% were pruned. The average nest height was 14.2 m and nests were observed mainly in secondary branches (59.3%). The occupancy rate was 89.7% and was associated to nest height and type of branch. During two reproductive seasons we quantified eggs and nestlings in chambers averaging 4.5 and 4.2, respectively. We provide a rough population size estimate and the characteristics of Monk Parakeets nest and tree selectivity, aiming to characterize several decades of a neglected urban invasion to warrant strategies for improved management measures. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Correction to: Scientific Reportshttps://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-68072-9, published online 24 July 2024 The original version of this Article contained errors. Original Ref 10 was not appropriate reference to support the statement where it was cited. It is therefore now replaced by a new Ref 10, and new Ref 11 and 12 are further added to support this statement. As a result, in the Introduction, “The easiest and least environmentally damaging method of exploiting lithium is from brines, while exploitation from ore rocks has severe environmental consequences10.” now reads: “The easiest and least environmentally damaging method of exploiting lithium is from brines, while exploitation from ore rocks has severe environmental consequences10,11, 12.” and in References, “10.

Secondly, as a result of a mix-up with data sources the special coverage of the Jadar project was incorrectly estimated. Additionally, one of the numbers was given incorrectly due to a typo. This is now corrected using original Ref 28 (now Ref 30) as a sole source of information. In ‘Ecological risk assessment of the Jadar lithium mine in Western Serbia’, “The preliminary estimated spatial coverage of the Jadar project is between 2031 and 2431 ha, with 533 ha of land expected to be destroyed during the initial phase of the project implementation. Of the land to be destroyed, 203 ha are forests, and 317 ha is arable land.” now reads: “The preliminary estimated spatial coverage of the Jadar project is 2031, with 533 ha of land expected to be destroyed during the initial phase of the project implementation. Of the land to be destroyed, 206.5 ha are forests, and 173 ha is arable land.” Additionally, original Ref 27 was incorrectly used in the same section. It was now removed – original Ref 31 (now Ref 33) cited at the end of the paragraph supports it in its entirety. As a result, in ‘Ecological risk assessment of the Jadar lithium mine in Western Serbia’, “The planned “Jadar” project is expected to cause significant habitat destruction and fragmentation, resulting in severe negative impacts on the living world, including several hundred plant and animal species. Among these species, 145 have protected and strictly protected status27. The project would also threaten the isolated eastern enclave of T. scorodonia, a sub-Atlantic species located more than 600 km away from the nearest western population. Additionally, the rare fern Dryopteris and 20 other rare species would disappear from the site of the planned tailings lands, as reported by Krizmanić et al. in 202131.” now reads: “The planned “Jadar” project is expected to cause significant habitat destruction and fragmentation, resulting in severe negative impacts on the living world, including several hundred plant and animal species. Among these species, 145 have protected and strictly protected status. The project would also threaten the isolated eastern enclave of T. scorodonia, a sub-Atlantic species located more than 600 km away from the nearest western population. Additionally, the rare fern Dryopteris and 20 other rare species would disappear from the site of the planned tailings lands, as reported by Krizmanić et al. in 202133.” Incorrect annual production tonnages were used when discussing the previous feasibility study. In ‘Eco‑chemical risk of jadarite mining and lithium extraction’, “Based on a feasibility study45, the annual production of Li2CO3 would be 50,000 t/year, and B(OH)3 production would reach 248,000 t/year.” now reads: “Based on a feasibility study47, the annual production of Li2CO3 would be 58,000 t/year, and B(OH)3 production would reach 286,000 t/year.” Additionally, in the same section, “We predict that with the mine opening, in addition to the presented problems that will multiply, new problems would arise due to pond tailings the company plans to place next to the two torrential rivers Korenita and Jadar and also in Štavica River valley uphill from the lithium boron mine and ore processing plant.“ now reads “We predict that with the mine opening, in addition to the presented problems that will multiply, new problems would arise due to tailings the company plans to place next to the two torrential rivers Korenita and Jadar and also in Štavica River valley uphill from the lithium boron mine and ore processing plant. The landfill in Štavica river would block river’s free flow and create a pond.” In ‘Socio‑environmental risks of Rio‑Tinto’s jadarite mining project in Serbia’, “During the initial stages of the proposed mining project, some residents allowed sample drilling on their properties without realizing that their land was located on the planned tailings pond.” now reads: “During the initial stages of the proposed mining project, some residents allowed sample drilling on their properties without realizing that their land was located on the planned tailings.” In original Ref 31 (now Ref 33), an initial of one of the authors was incorrect: “Anđelković, A.” in the author list now reads “Anđelković, M”. Finally, in the Supplemental Information 1, a methodological description of the sample collection and preparation, ICP-OES measurements, and calibration was also included (as a result, SI file contains new References 4–10; subsequent references were re-ordered accordingly).

	abstract = {In the city of Temuco, Chile, the importance of urban wetlands has been recognized with the legal declaration of two key ecosystems: Humedal Vegas de Chivilcán and Humedales de Antumalén. This paper presents an inventory of birds in these wetlands, following the Darwin Core standard, and compares the results with other selected inventories in Chile. Observations were made using point counts and 21-hour transects. A total of 50 species from 26 families and 15 orders were identified, with a predominance of native species. Fourteen species were found in both wetlands, 20 exclusively in Chivilcán and 15 in Antumalén. Comparison with other studies revealed significant differences in bird composition between urban and peri-urban habitats, illustrating that urban habitats maintain a unique diversity distinct from that of peri-urban areas. The diversity of habitats and the ‘least concern’ status of most species highlight the importance of these wetlands as refuges for avian biodiversity. The structure of the Darwin Core database facilitates their integration with other biodiversity systems, highlighting the need for continued conservation and study of these urban ecosystems. © 2024, Universidade Estadual de Campinas UNICAMP.

	abstract = {Chile, the world’s largest copper producer, generates massive amounts of mine tailings that are a source of ongoing environmental concern for local communities. The main objective of this work is to evaluate the concentration of As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Zn and SO42− in soils, water and vegetation in the communities surrounding the Cu Ovejería mine tailings dam, in central Chile. Soils, water and plants samples were collected from the towns of Chacabuco, Huechún, Huertos Familiares, Punta Peuco and Santa Matilde, which are located at 3 to 8 km from the mine tailings site, operated by CODELCO since 1999. The results showed that the levels of metals/metalloids and SO42− in water (pH 6.7–7.9) met both WHO limits and Chilean water quality standards for multiples uses. In soil (pH 7.7–8.4), total and available concentrations of metals/metalloids did not exceed international reference values. Plants with acceptable levels of metals and S were Citrus limon, Eucalyptus, Schinus molle, Prunus persica, Medicago sativa, Citrus sinensis and Ficus carica. The only species with Fe content well above the reference value and with high concentrations of other metals (Cu, Mn, Mo and Pb) was Acacia caven. The concentrations of chemical species determined between 2015 and 2018, in different media and locations near the active Cu tailings dam Ovejeria, in central Chile, allow to conclude that in general the levels are comparable to national and international references and do not indicate contamination. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

Chile is home to important dune ecosystems such as the emblematic Ritoque coastal dunes located in the hotspot for biodiversity conservation in central Chile where there is a delicate relationship between conservation and human development interests, among local communities and authorities. Here, we performed a choice experiment study to determined willingness to implement conservation measures in the Ritoque dunes. In particular, we assessed residents’ preferences for improvements of the current state of local ecosystem services such as scenic beauty, biodiversity and archaeological sites. Residents showed preferences for improvements in Ritoque coastal dunes’ ecosystem services, and a high willingness to pay for protecting biodiversity and archeological sites, rather than for recreational infrastructure. Our study highlights the importance of place-based research that specifically addresses residents and stakeholders’ conservation priorities, which could be used to design and implement effective conservation management strategies for coastal ecosystems and coastal cities near them. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Cities commonly support a high abundance of non-native species that can affect both wildlife and human health; however, their distribution across the urban environment and their relationship with socioeconomics are not well documented. Here, we map the abundance of three non-native birds in a Latin American city—domestic pigeon (Columba livia f. domestica), house sparrow (Passer domesticus), and monk parakeet (Myiopsitta monachus)—and investigate the effect of socioeconomics on their abundance. We found that C. livia f. domestica exhibited a random distribution of abundance across the city but reached its greatest abundance in low-income areas. P. domesticus exhibited an aggregated distribution of abundance, being most abundant in the southern and western areas of the city and in low-income areas. M. monachus exhibited an aggregated distribution of abundance, being most abundant in the northeastern part of the city and reaching its greatest abundance in high-income areas. Low-income areas likely provide high abundance of food, shelter, and nesting sites for both C. livia f. domestica and P. domesticus, whereas high income areas have greater tree cover and larger trees in which M. monachus can build communal nests. Our study finds that the abundance of non-native birds varies across the city and between socioeconomic groups; therefore, targeted management is needed in different city zones to limit negative effects on native species and prevent zoonotic diseases. © 2023 by the authors.},

The results of co-occurrence null model revealed that species associations are structured in one of three models, whereas two models revealed that species associations are random, whereas the results of the niche sharing null model revealed the absence of niche sharing, which would indicate the lack of interspecific competition.

	abstract = {One of the most peculiar biological interactions between pollinators and plants is the use of flowers as sleeping places, but this phenomenon is still poorly understood and it has been proposed to use citizen science in the form of volunteer records to fill the knowledge gaps. In this work, we report for the first time on the use of flowers as sleeping places by five species of Chilean flies of the genus Lasia (Acroceridae) in central Chile. In addition, we seek to determine whether the flower shape and/or color might be good predictors for flies using them as sleeping places. We used standardized records from a long-term citizen science project that exclusively monitors flies. We counted the number of flies that used flowers as a sleeping place and discretized the morphological variables of the flowers to relate both responses and predictors with a generalized linear model. We found that flowers belonging to the genus Alstroemeria, followed by Clarkia and Salpiglossis, were the most used as sleeping places. Our results suggest that zygomorphic flowers (with bilateral symmetry, and usually tubular flowers) are a better predictor than actinomorphic flowers and their color. The use of zygomorphic flowers could represent a better option for flies in adverse environmental conditions or to avoid predators, but the use of flowers as sleeping places could be an as-yet poorly understood way of pollinating plants. Citizen science, although it has some limitations (taxonomic, spatial or temporal biases), has great potential for describing new biological interactions in a changing world. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {Invasive species are one of the most important drivers of biodiversity loss worldwide. As exotic species invade new ecosystems, they establish ecological interactions with the existing species, which may facilitate their spread. Flower colour is an important trait that influences pollination and pollinator preferences. To determine the role of these variables on the bumblebee preferences, we compared the floral associations of two exotic bumblebee species: Bombus terrestris and B. ruderatus (introduced two decades ago for crop pollination) and the native B. dahlbomii with native and exotic plants in Chile. We analysed 3,019 citizen science records in order to understand bumblebee associations with native and exotic plant species regarding flower colour. We found that the exotic bumblebees were mainly recorded visiting flowers of exotic plants (86% for B. terrestris and 93% for B. ruderatus), while the native B. dahlbomii visited exotic and native plant species in a similar proportion. Also, the exotic bumblebees visited purple and pink flowers more often, while the native bumblebee species frequently visited white, pink, and purple flowers. Although the three species share trichromatic vision, they seem to have different flower colour preferences. The association of B. terrestris and B. ruderatus with exotic non-crop species (i.e., exotic ornamental plants) may be acting as steppingstones from croplands to other habitats, facilitating the bee invasion process.

	abstract = {Endemic to Patagonia, the White-throated Caracara (Phalcoboenus albogularis) is one of the least studied caracara species, with several aspects of its ecology, such as breeding biology and diet, largely unexplored. Using citizen science records and opportunistic observations, we obtained data on the breeding biology, nest sites, and diet of the species in Chile and Argentina. Nests were in rocky outcrops and cliffs, and aspects of diet corroborated others' observations that this species feeds on live prey as well as carrion. The species' nesting season apparently begins in September and ends in March, with some regional variation. The modal brood size is two, and many nests apparently are used across multiple years. Using citizen science data, we created the first distribution models for the White-throated Caracara, one for the breeding season and one for the winter season. The species predominantly occupies the highland plateaus of western Santa Cruz Province, Argentina, and the Andes Range from around 40° south to southern Tierra del Fuego. The models indicate a mostly consistent distribution without significant latitudinal changes between seasons and, apparently, only a limited transition to lower-elevation areas east of the Andes in winter. In both seasons, this caracara is associated primarily with barren rocky areas and Andean and sub-Andean herbaceous steppe - all open environments - rather than forested areas as has been thought previously. This study provides new knowledge of this regional endemic yet the species remains a poorly known raptor in southern South America. Additional and on-the-ground field research would likely produce benefits when addressing species-related conservation issues. © 2024 Ornithological Societies of North America. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Wetlands are habitats of high diversity and global importance that are suffering increasing anthropogenic pressure, especially riparian estuaries in urban areas. One of them in the Mediterranean area of Chile is the Petrel wetland. Bird diversity was evaluated through monthly monitoring between April 2020 and March 2023. The taxonomic diversity of the species (Rtp), the Shannon-Weaver community diversity index (H´) and the Pielou evenness index (J’) were determined. In addition, the effect of the sampling sites on richness, abundance and reproductive events was evaluated; and the effect of the seasonal period on richness and abundance, adjusting Poisson regression models. A total of 113 bird species were recorded, representing 57.1 % and 56.1 % of the orders and families described in Chile, respectively, observing a high diversity (2.49<H’<3.28) and evenness. (0.61<J’<0.81). Twenty-seven migratory species were recorded, of which 81.5 % were summer visitors. The sampling sites significantly affected richness, abundance and the number of reproductive events. The richness and abundance were significantly higher in the warm period. These results show that the Petrel wetland is a site of high diversity at the avifaunistic level in the central zone of Chile, it also constitutes a space that houses a significant number of migratory species. Our work provides key information to develop management and management plans, highlighting certain wetland sectors as priority areas for conservation. © 2023 The author(s) and 2023 Universidad de Concepción.},

We researched LULCC and landscape fragmentation in Arauco Province in Chile using satellite image analysis (1976–2016) and FRAGSTAT software. This area is in a constant struggle for land use between agroindustry, urban sprawl, and the expansion of exotic plantations (pine-eucalyptus) subsidized by Chilean government. The main results are: (1) we obtained the surface percentages for each land cover, (2) net changes for each cover by adding and losing surface (ha), (3) the transition map that enlightens the surface transformations of LULCC by its four processes substitution, abandonment, habilitation, regeneration and degradation, (4) the native forest loss in the first half of the period (1976–2001) was 1.85%/year, meanwhile for the second half (2001–2016) it was 6.5%/year, (5) landscape fragmentation processes occurred in patches and deforestation is its main driver, (6) aggregation changed the landscape since fragmentation and deforestation processes started the substitution of native forest, and (7) the habilitation of agricultural lands and degradation of wooded masses with exotic species increased their aggregation to 90%. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {An updated list of the Scarabaeoidea (Coleoptera) species registered in Chile is given, which includes current names, synonyms, and photographs of live specimens of 88 species. The photographs cover 35% of the species present in the country, with all families represented except for Glaresidae and Ochodaeidae. For each species, the geographical distribution is presented from north to south by administrative regions of the country. For species shared with neighboring countries, the distribution by provinces or departments is indicated, while for those that have a worldwide distribution, the countries, or regions where they have been reported are cited. This list includes species whose presence in continental and insular Chile has been verified and confirmed by studying specimens from collections, excluding all records considered erroneous. The systematic ordering is carried out at the family, subfamily, and tribe level following the current classification of the group; genera and species are presented in alphabetical order. Paranimbus peruanus (Erichson) (Aphodiinae) is recorded for the first time in Chile based on specimens collected in the locality of Visviri (Arica and Parinacota Region). The known distribution is extended for the following species: Allidiostoma landbecki (Philippi), A. simplicifrons (Fairmaire), Archophileurus chaconus Kolbe, Brachysternus germaini (Ohaus), Chiasognathus beneshi Lacroix, Cyclocephala modesta Burmeister, Frickius costulatus Germain, Martinezostes posticus (Germar), Martinezostes ruizi Gutiérrez, Megathopa villosa Eschscholtz, Oogenius chilensis Ohaus, O. kuscheli Gutiérrez, Oryctomorphus maculicollis Guérin-Méneville, Paranimbus zoai Dellacasa, Paranomala undulata peruviana (Guérin-Méneville), Phytholaema fenestra Smith & Mondaca, Tesserodoniella meridionalis Vaz-de-Mello & Halffter, Macrodactylus farinosus Philippi, and Ulata argentina Saylor. Considering the great morphological variability and differences in the color pattern of the integument, Chiasognathus grantii holometallicus Rataj, 2012 and Chiasognathus megalodon Rataj, 2013 are considered new synonyms of Chiasognathus grantii Stephens, 1831. The study of the syntype of Copris punctatissima Curtis, 1844 confirms that this species belongs to the genus Homocopris Burmeister, 1846 and that is not conspecific with H. torulosus (Eschscholtz, 1822), therefore, the combination Homocopris punctatissimus (Curtis, 1844) new combination is established. The study of the syntype of Copris valdiviana Philippi, 1859 confirms that this species is a synonymy of Homocopris torulosus and not of H. puntatissimus. The morphological study of specimens of the genus Germarostes Paulian, 1982 and the comparison with Chilean specimens of Germarostes posticus (Germar, 1843), confirms that this last species really belongs to the genus Martinezostes Paulian, 1982, therefore, the combination Martinezostes posticus (Curtis, 1843) new combination is established. Based on the inconsistencies that exist with the current definition of the subfamily Melolonthinae, and on the results of a previous phylogenetic analysis, Lichniini is elevated to the category of subfamily, placing Lichniinae new status very close to Aclopinae. There are 79 genera, 251 species and 10 subspecies of Scarabaeoidea in Chile, belonging to the families Geotrupidae (three genera, 10 species), Glaresidae (one genus, one species), Hybosoridae (one genus, six species), Trogidae (one genus, 11 species), Lucanidae (nine genera, 31 species, nine subspecies), Ochodaeidae (one genus, one species), and Scarabaeidae (63 genera, 191 species, one subspecies). In addition, Onthophagus pilauco Tello, Verdú, Rossini, & Zunino, 2021, the first fossil scarab from Chile, is included. Approximately 58% of the listed species are endemic to the country, 39% are native to South America and 3% correspond to introduced species with a wide global distribution.

Two species were identified: Toxocara canis (14%) and Trichuris vulpis (5%), both with zoonotic potential. In addition, three epidemiological variables were evaluated: age, confinement and health status using the Chi-square tests, Fisher’s exact test and Odds ratio, finding statistical significance for the variables age (p<0.05) and confinement (p=0.001). Given that sampled dogs have owner, the results show the importance of responsible pet ownership, correct deworming, and the role of veterinarians in educating the population regarding the importance of animal health care and the associated risks of transmission of zoonotic parasites from pets to humans. © 2023 Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos.

	abstract = {Introduction: The nematode Gurltia paralysans is a neglected angio-neurotropic parasite causing chronic meningomyelitis in domestic cats (Felis catus) as well as wild felids of the genus Leopardus in South America. Adult G. paralysans nematodes parasitize the leptomeningeal veins of the subarachnoid space and/or meningeal veins of the spinal cord parenchyma. The geographic range of G. paralysans encompasses rural and peri-urban regions of Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Colombia and Brazil. Methods: This case report presents clinical and pathological findings of a G. paralysans-infected cat suffering from severe thrombophlebitis and meningomyelitis resulting in ambulatory paraparesis. Neurological examination of affected cat localized the lesions at the thoracolumbar (T3–L3) and lumbosacral (L4–Cd4) segments. Molecular and morphological characteristics of extracted nematodes from parasitized spinal cord veins confirmed G. paralysans. Additionally, data obtained from a questionnaire answered by cat owners of 12 past feline gurltiosis cases (2014–2015) were here analyzed. Questionnaire collected data on age, gender, geographic location, type of food, hunting behavior, type of prey, and other epidemiological features of G. paralysans-infected cats. Results and Discussion: Data revealed that the majority of cats originated from rural settlements thereby showing outdoor life styles with hunting/predatory behaviors, being in close contact to wild life [i.e. gastropods, amphibians, reptiles, rodents, birds, and wild felids (Leopardus guinia)] and with minimal veterinary assistance. Overall, this neglected angio-neurotropic G. paralysans nematode still represents an important etiology of severe thrombophlebitis and meningomyelitis of domestic cats living in endemic rural areas with high biodiversity of definitive hosts (DH), intermediary (IH), and paratenic hosts (PH). The intention of this study is to generate awareness among veterinary surgeons as well as biologists on this neglected feline neuroparasitosis not only affecting domestic cats but also endangered wild felid species of the genus Leopardus within the South American continent.

He was attracted by the country's climate and its traditional friendliness to German immigrants. A few years later, in 1897, Federico Phillippi, Director of the Museo Nacional de Historia Natural, welcomed Reiche as the new Head of the Botanical Section, a position he held until 1910. During his 21 years in Chile, Reiche worked intensively on the Chilean flora and was a prolific writer. Besides six volumes of the Estudios críticos de la Flora de Chile (1896–1911), several editions of Reiche's Plant Geography of Chile were published (1907, 1934–1937, 2013), a magnificent essay on Chiles’ Orchidaceae, Orchidaceae Chilensis (1910, reprint 2007), and several other minor works. On Reiche's suggestion, The Museo Nacional engaged Friedrich Kraenzlin (1847–1934) to write a treatment of the orchids of the Southern Cone. It was published in 1904 as the second volume of Orchidacearum Genera et Species. This work was widely criticized by many botanists, including Reiche himself. © 2023 LANKESTERIANA},

	abstract = {Biotic homogenization is a global phenomenon, mainly in urban areas where exotic species are dominant, contributing to the loss of native biodiversity. Gardening native flora to promote local biodiversity is becoming a conservation practice in urban settings. Therefore, in this study, we analyzed the representation of the Chilean native flora in the Chilean and international ornamental flower seed market to know which native plant seeds are sold. We found that native seed are absent in the local market and that the totality of seed supply in the market corresponds to species of exotic origin, mainly from the Palearctic region (43%). However, surprisingly, many Chilean flower seeds are traded in the international market (approximately 6% of the total Chilean flora). This lack of availability of native seeds for local consumers constitutes a bottleneck for ecological restoration initiatives. It is consistent with the greater abundance of exotic species in urban green areas and supports the hypothesis of biocultural homogenization. © 2023, Ornamental Horticulture. All Rights Reserved.},

	abstract = {Chilean flies play an important role in many aspects of phylogeny and evolution of Diptera given their uniqueness and direct link with the Gondwanan insect fauna. Many dipterists have considered the order to be one of the most diverse in Chile, but there are still many gaps of information to fill. This study updates the families, genera, and species known from Chile and addresses the evolutionary origin of most dipteran families—indicating which biogeographical layers they belong to. The taxonomic literature was thoroughly reviewed from 1967 until May 2024. Our investigation revealed a total of 97 families, 930 genera and 4,108 valid species, placing Diptera as one of the most specious insect orders in Chile. The diversity of the Lower Diptera (suborders Tipulomorpha, Psychodomorpha, Culicomorpha, Perissommatomorpha and Bibionomorpha) increased to 111 genera (93.27%) and 1,019 species (136.22%), whereas Brachycera increased to 229 genera (48.61%) and 703 species (50.72%). Specifically, the number of genera and species in the division Aschiza increased by 117.14% and 114.28% respectively, while Acalyptratae increased by 62.24% genera and 63.82% species to date. Finally, the number of genera and species in the Calyptratae increased by 31.05% and 50%, respectively. The family Neriidae is newly recorded for Chile and the species Telostylinus lineolatus (Wiedemann) is reported from Easter Island. We present age hypotheses of clades in Chile belonging to 60 families—of which 16 correspond to Cretaceous- and 46 to Cenozoic-, and a small number to Jurassic-elements. Finally, we address three major gaps for a more robust development of Diptera systematics in Chile: (1) lack of long-term systematic sampling, (2) taxonomic, spatial, and temporal biases for Diptera diversity and (3) poor understanding of biological and ecological processes related to Diptera facing advances in anthropogenic impacts across the country. © 2024 Magnolia Press.},

	abstract = {The Valdivian temperate rainforest (VTR) is a biome on the South American continent with high endemism that has experienced an intensive land-cover change in recent decades due to the expansion of agriculture, plantations of introduced forests, and urban growth. Today, the biome hosts key parts of the country’s agricultural and forestry industries. Previous studies focused on quantifying native forest and plantation cover area and exotic forest plantation area, among others. However, the importance of mountain areas as refuge of native forest in Chile remains unexplored. The aim of this research is to highlight the role of latitude and slope on land cover in the VTR. A new methodological approach was used combining global classified datasets. Our results indicate that high mountain areas are the core location of the remaining primary forests and endemism whereas low mountain areas are dominated by exotic forest plantations. Between 40–48° S (The Los Ríos, Los Lagos, and Aysén Regions and high-mountain areas), in general, serve as a natural reservoir where human-induced land-cover change has not occurred on a large scale. Most public and private conservation areas are in high mountain areas, whereas low mountain areas and plain areas lack conservation schemes and are more prone to land cover change towards forestry. Considering geomorphological features in land cover change analysis can reveal interesting new perspectives in this research area. © 2022 by the authors.},

The capacity of the strains to tolerate copper and zinc was evaluated, and their effect on the expression of genes related to metal tolerance in Solanum lycopersicum co-inoculated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Among the isolates, Lecythophora sp. and Hormonema viticola showed the highest tolerance to Cu (1150 mg kg|−1) and Zn (3200 mg kg−1), respectively. We detected the highest lactic and oxalic acid production lactic and oxalic acid production in Lecythophora sp. against Cu contamination. In contrast, a higher malic, lactic, and citric acid production was detected in H. viticola against Zn contamination. Regarding the expression involved in metal tolerance, we showed that both fungi reduce the expression of the genes MT, PCS, HSP, and NRAMP in S. lycopersicum growing under metal stress. We did not observe a significant positive effect of the co-inoculation with the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Rhizophagus irregularis in the relative expression genes in leaves, but a positive impact was detected in roots. The results showed that the co-inoculation of rhizosphere metal-tolerant fungi isolated from metallophyte species and mycorrhizal fungi decreased the expression of metal tolerance genes in S. lycopersicum growing under toxic Cu and Zn levels. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Ports are expanding urban systems worldwide which provide important economic benefits to local economies. But port land reclamation together with infrastructure deployment and operations, produce unprecedented pressure on surrounding coastal ecosystems. Thus, the implementation of effective management strategies to deal with social-environmental conflicts is often required. Only a few studies have addressed the socio-ecological link between port impact on coastal ecosystem services and how this related to social conflicts. Here, we use multidisciplinary research to address these questions considering two ports located in Coquimbo city-port (29°S) in Chile, as our study port-system. Index scores of port impacts on urban natural ecosystem services and the city were calculated from known drivers of decline. Questionnaires were used to identify local citizens’ concerns about port operations and expansion. Our results demonstrated significant pressures from port infrastructure and operations on maritime but also in shoreland coastal ecosystem services, which were perceived as a critical environmental concern by local respondents. There was low knowledge, but positive appreciation, of ecological engineering initiatives in urban environments to rehabilitate ecosystem attributes. Field experiments showed that biodiversity enhancement of port infrastructure is effective, and might be a good initiative to link people with the port. Our results suggest that port industries must engage in more explicit initiatives to compensate for the environmental impacts of the expansion of built infrastructure, resulting in more effective integration of these urban systems with natural ecosystems. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Due to their impact on biodiversity, human health, and livestock husbandry, we need to eradicate feral dogs. However, eradication usually encounters public opposition, which hinders its implementation and success. Persuasive messages could help us attain public support for feral dog eradication. We evaluated the effectiveness of two message frames to increase intentions to support eradication of feral dogs via lethal methods. Messages addressed the negative impacts of feral dogs on (1) human health and livestock husbandry (anthropocentric frame) and (2) wildlife (ecocentric frame). These frames were randomly assigned to 506 Chilean citizens and Chilean residents in a before-after survey experiment measuring attitudes, subjective norm, and behavioral intentions to support feral dog eradication via lethal methods. Both frames significantly increased behavioral intentions, attitude, and subjective norm, irrespective of participant demographics. Changes in attitude and subjective norm influenced change in intentions. Both frames can aid managers increase public support to eradicate feral dogs. © 2023 Elsevier GmbH},

	abstract = {The Neotropical region hosts 4225 freshwater fish species, ranking first among the world's most diverse regions for freshwater fishes. Our NEOTROPICAL FRESHWATER FISHES data set is the first to produce a large-scale Neotropical freshwater fish inventory, covering the entire Neotropical region from Mexico and the Caribbean in the north to the southern limits in Argentina, Paraguay, Chile, and Uruguay. We compiled 185,787 distribution records, with unique georeferenced coordinates, for the 4225 species, represented by occurrence and abundance data. The number of species for the most numerous orders are as follows: Characiformes (1289), Siluriformes (1384), Cichliformes (354), Cyprinodontiformes (245), and Gymnotiformes (135). The most recorded species was the characid Astyanax fasciatus (4696 records). We registered 116,802 distribution records for native species, compared to 1802 distribution records for nonnative species. The main aim of the NEOTROPICAL FRESHWATER FISHES data set was to make these occurrence and abundance data accessible for international researchers to develop ecological and macroecological studies, from local to regional scales, with focal fish species, families, or orders. We anticipate that the NEOTROPICAL FRESHWATER FISHES data set will be valuable for studies on a wide range of ecological processes, such as trophic cascades, fishery pressure, the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation, and the impacts of species invasion and climate change. There are no copyright restrictions on the data, and please cite this data paper when using the data in publications. © 2022 The Ecological Society of America.},

Here, we assessed the potential of roadsides and gardens to facilitate the spread of non-native clonal succulent species to coastal natural ecosystems. We surveyed urban habitats and rural wetlands located from 18°S to 23°S, in the coastal fringe of the Atacama Desert in northern Chile. Using generalized mixed linear models (GLMMs), we explored the effects of habitat extent and distance to urban sources as the main factors contributing to non-native species propagation. Non-native-to-native species spatial association were also examined. We found the occurrences of Sesuvium portulacastrum were higher in roadsides and gardens located from 18°S to 22°S, followed by Malephora crocea, Carpobrotus edulis and Mesembryanthemum (Aptenia) × vascosilvae. S. portulacastrum, followed by C. edulis and, to a lesser extent, M. × vascosilvae, were recorded in urban and rural crypto-wetlands. Increase in species occurrences with built habitat perimeter and a linear reduction by distance to urban sources were detected. Positive association of S. portulacastrum and M. crocea with the native Heliotropium curassavicum was recorded. These results highlight the importance of the coastal landscape composition (diversity and extent of habitat types) and configuration (distance from built to natural habitats) in the process of non-native plant species’ expansion. Given many coastal ecosystems are already damaged by different human-derived impacts, planting non-native succulents in urban habitats should be carefully managed to balance the services/disservices they provide/provoke to urban and natural habitats. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Latin American countries have a set of legal instruments and public policies that contribute to the protection of urban wetlands against the pressure of city expansion that threatens their extent and quality. With the aim of discussing the role of public policies and regulations in the protection of urban wetlands, the situation in Chile, Colombia, and Peru is analyzed in a comparative manner. These countries are examples of diverse regulations and wetland biodiversity in urban environments. Legal instruments for environmental protection and conservation, spatial planning, and urban planning relevant to the management of urban wetlands are analyzed. In addition, advances in regulation and protection of urban wetlands are evaluated and contrasted based on national-level indicators. The lack of effective protection measures is demonstrated. The three countries have adhered to the Ramsar Convention to protect their wetlands and have established Ramsar sites; however, their existence does not stop the pressures and threats to the wetlands. It is identified that Peru has a larger surface area of Ramsar sites and that Colombia has the most extensive Ramsar urban wetland. It is highlighted that Chile has a recent urban wetlands law, while in Colombia and Peru the category of urban wetland does not exist in legislation. Meanwhile, in the protected natural areas, urban wetlands practically have no presence. Among the main weaknesses are the disarticulation between sectors and planning scales; in addition to outdated planning instruments regarding current challenges such as climate change, the water crisis, and the loss of biodiversity. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

The feeding and spatial behavior of the chilla fox (Lycalopex griseus, G., 1837) and dogs were studied in the vicinity of a peri-urban protected area in south-central Chile. The diet of both canids was compared seasonally, for which feces were collected along trails in three habitats: native forest, exotic plantations and scrublands. Dog feces were collected at the same site to establish whether they were avoided by foxes. Chilla fox has been highlighted for consuming a high proportion of hares followed by rodents of the Muridae family, both being exotic mammals in Chile, whereas dogs showed a predominant consumption of anthropogenic food. Signifi cant differences were observed for chilla fox in dietary diversity, mainly in summer and fall. No spatial segregation was observed with the domestic dog, which was evidenced in a high overlap in the use of all habitats. This scenario, together with continuous human presence, are elements that must be considered in the medium-term to evaluate the effects of anthropogenic pressures on native carnivores in the study area. © 2022 Sciendo.

	abstract = {Local knowledge and values of coastal communities offer insights into the intricate human-nature relationships in the land-sea interface. Considering a diversity of values unveils how people perceive nature, encompassing both tangible and intangible dimensions, and this understanding is part of how they navigate dynamic environmental challenges by embracing livelihood diversification spanning land-sea activities. Better understanding of these values, relationships and diversification strategies can improve social-ecological systems theory and practice. Here we assess links between local knowledge, values and livelihoods in order to identify emerging tradeoffs. Using semi-structured interviews with qualitative and quantitative methods, we conducted a total of 88 interviews in five communities in Southern Chile. Local knowledge and values were collected as free-listing on terrestrial and marine species. We probed relationships between livelihood diversification and values, classified as relational, intrinsic, and instrumental. Our findings showed that marine species were most associated with instrumental values, while terrestrial species had a balance between relational, intrinsic and instrumental values. We observed that as communities expand their livelihoods and live closer to the city, they showed lower knowledge and values, and in these cases instrumental values predominate. Certain diversification strategies could lead to time constraints, impacting the transmission of knowledge and resulting in less values. Deeper and long-term cooperation between different actors to recover and protect different values is necessary to couple local knowledge and values with livelihood diversification. Our research provides valuable insights for policymakers aiming to develop holistic strategies that include relational values and leverage diverse knowledge systems to address contemporary environmental challenges. © 2024 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Global companion animal population has been increasing as well as the number of dogs and cats being considered as a family member. However, it is unclear whether this close relationship could be associated with higher preventive healthcare in companion animals. Using data from 7,048 questionnaires of dogs and 3,271 of cats from the First National Study on Responsible Companion Animal Ownership, we estimated the proportion of preventive healthcare in companion animals of Chile. We also conducted a general linear mixed-effect regression model to identify socioeconomic factors and indicators of the emotional owners-companion animal bond that could influence owners’ practices related to vaccination, parasite control, and veterinary visits. Based on the owner's answers, Chile has a satisfactory overall rates of parasite control (71%) and annual veterinary visits (65%) but a low vaccination coverage of both dogs (39%) and cats (25%). ‘Purebred’, ‘live in urban areas’, ‘acquired by monetary compensation’, and ‘dog species’ were associated with a higher probability of preventive healthcare in companion animals. Conversely, this probability was lower among senior animals compared to adults, males, and those owned by the Silent Generation or Baby Boomers (i.e., owners born before 1964). ‘Sleeping inside’, ‘acquired for an emotional reason’ (e.g., companionship), and ‘considered a family member’ were positively associated with at least one of assessed preventive measures. Our findings suggest that emotional owner-companion animal bonds could positively impact the frequency and quality of preventive healthcare in dogs and cats. However, owners who totally disagreed that a companion animal is a “family member” were also associated with a higher likelihood of vaccination uptake and veterinary visits for their animals. This highlights that owner's compliance with veterinary preventive healthcare is multifactorial. Chile has a high prevalence of infectious diseases circulating among dogs and cats and increasingly close contacts between owners and companion animals due to emotional bonds. Thus, our study calls for One Health approaches to reduce the risks of cross-species disease transmission. Specifically, increasing vaccination coverage of companion animals in Chile is the most urgent preventive measure needed, especially among cats, males, and older animals. Expand preventive healthcare among dogs and cats will promote public and animal health, including local wildlife that is susceptible to infectious diseases circulating in companion animals. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

Insect sampling was conducted (February 2021 to March 2022) using yellow pan traps. Two sites will be sampled on each of the seven studied lettuce crops. Land use and land cover classes were defined: Forests, water bodies, shrub vegetation, grasslands, barren lands, impermeable surfaces, and urban areas. After land use and land cover classification, buffers of 500 to 5,000 m were created around each data collection point. For data analysis, the percentages of land use of different classes were compared with the ecological attributes: Abundance of insects, abundance of insect pests, richness of entomological families and types of oral apparatus (licker-sucker, mandible, picker-sucker, and sucker).

They are the habitats of many species and play a key role in sustaining biodiversity in different ecosystems. However, anthropogenic activity can result in eutrophication of water bodies, favoring the excessive growth of microorganisms, which can be a risk factor for animal, human, and environmental health. The Agricultural and Livestock Service [Servicio Agrícola y Ganadero (SAG)] of Chile developed a list of Mandatory Reportable Diseases (MRD) to report suspected contagious diseases of veterinary relevance. In this sense, the detection of microorganisms in water bodies for the characterization of their sanitary status is important for the development of monitoring strategies and the prevention of possible diseases. This study aimed to determine the presence of potentially harmful bacteria in Llanquihue urban wetlands. Here, we used metagenomic sequencing of amplicons to characterize the composition of microorganisms in three urban wetlands in the city of Llanquihue, which could be a risk factor for animal health. Our main finding was the detection of genera that may be associated with MRD, in addition to other microbial genera that have pathogenic potential. On the other hand, we also report the presence of cyanobacteria genera that can be involved in toxin production in water bodies as another potential source of risk. This is the first study to use massive sequencing techniques to analyze the sanitary status of urban wetlands in the city of Llanquihue. © 2024 Universidad Austral de Chile. All rights reserved.},

However, its actual and potential distribution and the natural history of this interaction are scarcely known. In this note, we describe the distribution, habitat use and phenology of the species in Chile. Additionally, we present data on feeding events of Screaming Cowbird fledglings by Austral Blackbirds. For doing so, we analyzed data from a citizen-science project using Maxent and Random Forest models. We found that the Screaming Cowbird is distributed mainly in urban and agricultural habitats, avoiding native shrublands and forests. The potential distribution is driven by the temperature and the Austral Blackbird distribution. This note confirms the relationship between both species of icterids and gives new insights into how new host-parasite interactions can drive the range expansion of brood parasitic birds. © 2023 The author(s).},

	abstract = {Characterizing the composition of divers visiting different diving areas could help to design marine citizen science (MCS) projects that support biodiversity monitoring and marine conservation. Recreational scuba divers mostly prefer warm and clear waters with coral reefs, and based on the Duffus and Dearden’s wildlife tourism framework we hypothesized that a more popular diving area is visited mostly by generalist divers, whereas in a less popular diving area a higher proportion of specialist divers would be found. Recreational scuba divers were surveyed in diving centres at two diving areas, Rapa Nui (more popular, with warm and clear coral-reef waters) and the Chilean mainland (less popular, with productive and temperate–cold waters), to determine their diving profile, visiting profile, marine species knowledge, and interest and participation in MCS. Support for our hypothesis (generalist divers on Rapa Nui and specialist divers on the mainland) was weak, but recreational divers on Rapa Nui were mostly foreign visitors who come for single visits, whereas divers from the mainland were predominantly Chileans who return repeatedly to the diving area. In both diving areas the divers expressed a strong interest to be trained and to participate in MCS, but divers from Rapa Nui were interested in brief pre-dive inductions, whereas divers from the Chilean mainland preferred intensive training courses. Based on these findings we recommend specific MCS strategies for divers in both types of areas, e.g. simple protocols in more popular diving areas, with short pre-dive briefings for divers, and medium or long-term programmes in areas where most divers are local with high return rates. In these latter conditions more extensive training will be useful, which allows divers to gain more experience and assume higher responsibilities within an MCS project. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Conversion of natural land covers to agriculture is a major cause of the global biodiversity decline. Bats are an important component of biodiversity in agricultural landscapes because they provide pest control services. Although management recommendations towards the enhancement of insectivorous bat populations in agro-ecosystems have previously been highlighted, little information is available for promoting bat conservation within viticultural landscapes. In the present study, we examined the role of the adjacent habitat on bat activity in vineyards of central Chile. We also evaluated differences in bat activity between the edges and the interiors of the vineyards in relation to the type of adjacent habitat. To accomplish this, we conducted acoustic surveys along edge and the interior of 16 vineyards bordering different adjacent habitats. Overall bat activity in vineyards was not influenced by the adjacent habitat type, but it was by the location within the vineyard; edges showed significant higher activity than the interior of the vineyards. Vineyards adjacent to native vegetation showed the highest levels of activity for Lasiurus varius, Lasiurus villosissimus and Myotis chiloensis compared to those adjacent to monoculture or urban areas. All bat species were most active at the edges of the vineyards as compared to the interior, which increase the probability of this group providing ecosystem services in vineyards. Therefore, vineyard edges, in particular those adjacent to native vegetation, should be considered as part of agricultural management in order to promote bat diversity and abundance in this crop. © 2021 Museum and Institute of Zoology PAS.

	abstract = {Urban development modifies the habitat of reptiles where we expect, the individuals to select available sites with the quality necessary for their permanence. The aim of this study was to determine the variables that favored the habitat selection and abundance of The Zapallaren Tree Iguana Liolaemus zapallarensis, an endemic species of Chile, during a winter season in Changa beach, Coquimbo, in northern Chile. Between June and September 2017, we made 30 random visits to 18 plots of 900 m2 each. We estimated a resource selection probability function for presence-absence and abundance data using local habitat (e.g. slope, distance from the protection wall to the sea at low tide, interior height of the wall, mean height of the vegetation, rocky surface, and vegetal surface) and climatic variables (temperature, atmospheric pressure, direction and wind speed, solar radiation, and mean cloudiness) as predictors. Vegetation cover was the most important habitat variable explaining the presence of L. zapallarensis. In addition, increase in cloudiness and wind speed decreased the probability of selection. Manly’s selectivity measure varied according to the established home ranges and the availability ratios within them. Final-ly, increase in cloudiness and wind speed decreased the abundance. Overall, our results show that the characteristics related to habitat and local climate influences the resource selection that favors the survival of reptiles. This work shows that beach sectors in urban contexts under anthropic pressure have important available resources that favor the presence and abundance of reptiles. © 2020 The author(s).

	abstract = {Harmful algal blooms (HABs) are a major concern for Chilean scientists and governmental authorities, due to their deleterious effects on the aquaculture industry, resulting in complex sanitary, economic, and social problems. Increasingly, intense and frequent HABs events have distressed the aquaculture industry in recent years, especially for the occurrence of previously unreported toxic microalgae species. In the context of HAB monitoring programs, we review recent major advances in new approaches that have enabled deeper understanding of HAB species diversity in Chile. In particular, molecular approaches have revealed exceptional cryptic diversity, and chemotaxonomic approaches exposed the presence of new phycotoxins belonging to still undetected HAB species using conventional light microscopy. New advances in the detection of ichthyotoxins through the use of a fish cell line assay promises an early incorporation of this technique in routine monitoring of community composition. Emerging imaging flow cytometry is progressively pushing monitoring to more automated capabilities, and citizen science is gradually involving local communities in the complex phenomenon of harmful algal blooms. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

To better assess the diversity of bats there, we conducted acoustic surveys at Arica city and three coastal valleys (Azapa, Lluta and Camarones) in the Arica and Parinacota region, Chile. We obtained 82 acoustic records of the Peale's free-tailed bat (Nyctinomops aurispinosus) in nine sites within the region. This species had not been previously documented in Chile but was known from adjacent Tacna province, Peru. Echolocation calls of N. aurispinosus can be distinguished from other molossid bat species occurring in the area by its lower frequency range. Our data suggest a wide distribution of N. aurispinosus across the coastal valleys of the Arica and Parinacota region, where they were active in both natural and anthropized habitats. This southernmost record of N. aurispinosus for the Pacific coast, extends its known range ca. 150 km southward, and increases up to 15 the number of bat species in Chile.  © 2022 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.},

	abstract = {Invasive alien species may cause substantial changes and damaging impacts. Here, we document the current distribution and ecological interactions with native biota of relatively recently introduced wasps, Vespula vulgaris and V. germanica, in the southern part of the Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve (CHBR) in southern Chile. We conducted field studies in four different habitats on Navarino Island: evergreen, deciduous and mixed forests, and shrublands. The spread of V. vulgaris throughout the island has led to it occupying suitable habitats in both urban and rural settings, while V. germanica has not been observed in the last 2 years. The presence of V. vulgaris in remote areas of the CHBR is likely the result of human-mediated movement through the channels within the reserve. The composition of foraged items was different in each of the four studied habitats, yet strongly linked to the resources of each, indicating the inherent ability of V. vulgaris to exploit available resources efficiently. V. vulgaris mainly forages berries from shrubs, and preys on a variety of arthropods, particularly hoverflies, craneflies and lepidoptera larvae. The lack of natural competitors and availability of multiple resources has allowed V. vulgaris to rapidly become a common pest in urban and rural settings in the southern extremity of South America. While we consider that eradication would now be impossible, population control at local scales may still be possible with proper planning and long-term management. Our data provide a baseline for management planning, and we strongly recommend social engagement and dialog with relevant governmental institutions to achieve this challenging task. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {First published as part of this issue. See online for details. A month after the online publication of our article, several nomenclatural issues were brought to our attention. First, we realized the existence of Eremiolirion J.C.Manning & F.Forest (in Bothalia 35(2): 117. 2005) in Tecophilaeaceae, which resembles the newly described Eremolirion Nic.García (in Taxon 68(3): 494. 2019) in Amaryllidaceae. Given that these names have identical Greek derivations and that they are so similar that they are likely to be confused (Art. 53.2), it is necessary to give a replacement name for the latter: Paposoa Nic.García, nom. nov. ≡ Eremolirion Nic.García in Taxon 68(3): 494. 2019, non Eremiolirion J.C.Manning & F.Forest 2005 – Type: Paposoa laeta (Phil.) Nic.García, comb. nov. ≡ Rhodophiala laeta Phil., Fl. Atacam.: 51. 1860 ≡ Eremolirion laetum (Phil.) Nic.García in Taxon 68(3): 494. 2019. Etymology. – Reference to the coastal locality of Paposo in the Chilean region of Antofagasta, where this species is a characteristic component of fog oases. All instances where Eremolirion appears in our article, particularly in the key to genera of Hippeastreae, Figure 1 and Table 1, should be replaced by the new name Paposoa. Second, we gave replacement names that in three cases were illegitimate and superfluous. We have now reconsidered the synonymy for these three taxa and for one other, and, consequently, proceed to perform the correct combinations given the earliest legitimate epithets available in Zephyranthes Herb. (Art. 11.4). In the first case, the replacement name was superfluous, even if Habranthus mendocinus Phil. (in Anales Univ. Chile 21: 406. 1862) was not considered a later synonym of Habranthus gilliesianus (Herb.) M.Roem. (Fam. Nat. Syn. Monogr. 4: 98. 1847), because the combination of H. mendocinus into Zephyranthes Herb. (Appendix: 36. 1821) would have not been a later homonym of Zephyranthes mendocensis Baker (Handb. Amaryll.: 36. 1888), given the definition of a homonym in Art. 53.1 and that it is not possible to consider these epithets (i.e., mendocinus vs. mendocensis) sufficiently alike to be confused (Art. 53.2). Additionally, we provide full synonymies for these four species: Zephyranthes gilliesiana (Herb.) Nic.García, comb. nov. ≡ Habranthus bagnoldianus var. gilliesianus Herb., Amaryllidaceae: 166. 1837 ≡ Habranthus gilliesianus (Herb.) M.Roem., Fam. Nat. Syn.

Considering that Hippeastrum tubispathum Pax (in Bot. Jahrb. Syst. 11: 329. 1889) is an illegitimate later homonym of Hippeastrum tubispathum Baker (in J. Bot. 16: 82. 1878), it cannot provide a basionym according to Art. 6.10 & 49.1. Therefore, the citation of this synonym should be: Zephyranthella tubispatha Pax in Engler & Prantl, Nat. Pflanzenfam., ed. 2, 15a: 416. 1930.

	abstract = {Sarcoptic mange has been anecdotally reported in Chilean wildlife during the last decade. Although this disease can have devastating outcomes for biodiversity, there is no comprehensive assessment of this potential threat in Chile. Because the current capacity to monitor sarcoptic mange and other wildlife diseases is limited in this country, we used abnormal alopecia to search for suspect cases across several sources of information to identify, to the extent available data allow, the location and temporal trends of wild mammals with this characteristic across Chile. We surveyed park rangers, examined rehabilitation center databases, and collated citizen and media reports. The information gathered suggests that observations of alopecic wild mammals, mainly foxes (Lycalopex sp.), their presence in the country, and the number of species fulfilling our case definition have increased over the last 15 years. Moreover, abnormally alopecic mammals are currently located broadly in Chile. We also confirmed the utility of abnormal alopecia to define a suspect sarcoptic mange case in the most commonly affected group, Lycalopex foxes. Our findings are highly concerning from a conservation perspective. We thus emphasize the need for an urgent surveillance and management plan for sarcoptic mange and other diseases that may be threatening Chilean biodiversity. © 2020 Associação Brasileira de Ciência Ecológica e Conservação},

Specimens of the non-native kelp were collected during successive surveys for molecular and morphological analyses, and reproductive viability tests. The species was determined using two mitochondrial molecular markers, COI and trnW-L. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed the taxonomic identity of the specimen as S. japonica and revealed a genetic similarity with S. japonica × S. latissima hybrid cultivars Sanhai and Rongfu. In April 2021, several adult specimens became fertile at the farm site and the laboratory and released meiospores were able to develop into embryos after 15–20 days of incubation.

This is the case with the recently rediscovered saproxylic beetle Sclerostomulus nitidus (Benesh, 1955), rediscovered in 2012, whose only known global population inhabits one sole mountain, Cerro Poqui, Chile. We sampled 146 dead logs per year and found that abundance per log of Sclerostomulus nitidus decreased by 93% in a 5-year period (2013–2018) and estimated the probability of finding at least one individual is likely to approach zero by 2030 following a linear trend. Sclerostomulus nitidus is listed as Critically Endangered by Chilean Law due to restricted geographic range, but we propose a need for new IUCN Red Listing resulting from our observations of ongoing population size reduction and the projected probabilities of finding an individual. While in the field, we witnessed ongoing collection and so present evidence of online trade of Sclerostomulus nitidus. Therefore, to complement the study of the ecology of S. nitidus, we suggest a focus on unifying national and international policies regarding traded or trafficked species. National policy might be up to speed, but international legislation regarding trading of wildlife, such as CITES, are outdated. Making national and international policy compatible would open possibilities for serious discussions with courier services regarding transparency and monitoring processes used to stop unfettered trading or trafficking to which recently rediscovered species are most vulnerable. © 2020 Royal Entomological Society},

	abstract = {The decapod fauna in the intertidal zone of the rocky shores of Chile is highly diverse, especially along the northern and central mainland coasts, where the influence of the cold Humboldt Current results in high productivity. One of the most abundant species in these ecosystems is the decapod Cyclograpsus cinereus Dana, 1851. The aim of the present study, carried out in the spring and summer seasons between 2018 and 2020, was to determine the spatial distribution patterns of the decapod C. cinereus in different sites along the rocky shores of Antofagasta bay, northern Chile, in order to establish probabilistic models that explain its distribution at each site. Individuals were counted in random quadrants in the intertidal zone. The data thus obtained were processed by application of the variance/mean ratio to determine whether the distribution of individuals was random, aggregated or uniform, associated with Poisson, negative binomial or positive binomial distributions, respectively. The data revealed aggregated (negative binomial) distribution in 15 sampling events, and uniform (positive binomial) distribution in 4 events. The sampling sites were located on rocky shores in four sectors of an urban zone, and two in a protected zone; no significant differences were found between the densities of the sites in the two zones. The results of the interpretative probabilistic models indicated aggregated distribution patterns, agreeing with previously reported interpretative probabilistic models for the distribution of decapods on the rocky shores of central and southern Chile. © 2022 by the authors.

Simultaneously, a series of wildlife sightings—mainly in urban areas—have been brought to public attention and often attributed to lockdown measures. Here we report on a series of wild carnivore records, including threatened species, obtained through camera traps set in urban forests, campuses, suburbs, and peri-urban areas of two cities in Chile, during partial lockdown measures. Our records are novel for Chile, a country where urban carnivore ecology is mostly unknown, and include the detection of four native carnivores, including the vulnerable güiña (Leopardus guigna) and the endangered southern river otter (Lontra provocax). These records also constitute a valuable baseline collected during partial lockdown measures in two cities of the Global South. We emphasize, however, that these findings cannot be used to argue for or against an effect of lockdown measures on wildlife. More generally, we call for caution in the interpretation of seemingly novel carnivore records during periods of lockdown and stress the value of international collaboration in evaluating the effects of the Anthropause on wildlife. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Toxoplasma gondii is a zoonotic cosmopolitan protozoan that causes a high mortality rate among zoo mammals such as New World primates, meerkats, marsupials and Pallas’ cat. It has been recently reported in Chile, mainly among wild populations, but also as the cause of death of a kangaroo and a mara. However, there has not been a T. gondii report at a Zoo population level in Chile in the last 35 years. The aim of the study was to estimate the seroprevalence and risk factors associated with T. gondii infection in mammals housed in a zoo located in the Metropolitan Region of Chile between 2011 and 2018. In this study, we analyzed 350 samples, from 324 animals, belonging to 57 species of carnivores, non-human primates, macropodids, ungulates and rodents to detect the presence of anti-T. gondii antibodies. Additionally, 20 animals were longitudinally sampled to evaluate intra-zoo infection. Using a commercial indirect Enzyme-Linked Immuno Sorbent Assay (ELISA) test, we detected T. gondii antibodies in 72 (22.2 %) samples. The overall seroprevalence estimates were 48.4 % in felines, 22.9 % in non-feline carnivores, 21.1 % in ungulates and 15.0 % in non-human primates. There were no positive samples from rodents or marsupials. Of animals sampled longitudinally, only a culpeo fox (Lycalopex cualpaeus) became seropositive along the study indicating exposition inside the facility. T. gondii seroprevalence differed significantly in taxonomic groups (p = 0.003), felines are statistically different from non-feline carnivores (NFC) (p = 0.040), ungulate (p = 0.027) and non-human primates (NHP) (p = 0.009). Annual prevalence comparison was performed showing no statistical difference (p = 0.941). A multivariable logistic regression was performed to ascertain the effect of taxonomic groups, proximity to water sources, diet, sex and type of housing on seropositivity. Only taxonomic group was statistically significant, indicating that NFC (OR = 0.35; 95 % CI = 0.15 – 0.83; p = 0.017), ungulates (OR = 0.30; 95 % CI = 0.13 – 0.69; p = 0.005), and NHP (OR = 0.25; 95 % CI = 0.09 – 0.72; p = 0.010) have lower risk of positivity to T. gondii compared to felines. Additionally, a black-faced spider monkey (Ateles chamek) and a siamang (Symphalangus syndactylus) were seropositive, being the first description of T. gondii infection in these species worldwide. As seen in previous studies, the widespread presence and exposure of T. gondii in zoo mammals was confirmed, and there may be contact with the agent and transmission within the zoo, which was confirmed by one animal became seropositive over the time. This fact could be a health problem for animals susceptible to fatal toxoplasmosis. © 2021},

	abstract = {Bees are a diverse group of insects that have tremendous importance as pollinators. In recent decades, there has been a global decline in bee populations because of land-use change, intensive agriculture, and climate change. Unfortunately, our knowledge of native bees’ ecology is rather scarce, and such knowledge gaps are also a major threat to its conservation. In this sense, biological collections are a priceless natural history legacy and an information source for new research and decision making. Chile has a remarkable bee diversity, with 464 species currently known from Chile and a high incidence of endemism and a variety of habitats (including the Mediterranean biodiversity hotspot). The largest wild bee collection in Chile is held at the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso (comprising a century of data). This collection has been recently included in GBIF. Here we present a database with 36,010 records, including information on sociality and ecology (including information on floral visitation range, the resource collected, and nesting substrates) for 160 out of the 167 bee species included (36% of the Chilean bee diversity, including 49 genera and five families). All records have the taxonomy resolved, and 83% of them have geographic coordinates, covering a latitudinal range between 18° S and 53° S from the continental and insular territories.

	abstract = {Plant diversity in large cities has recently become a subject of intense biological research. Urban green spaces are widely acknowledged to improve people's quality of life. Unlike in wild areas, plants in urban ecosystems develop in spaces strongly managed by human activity and tend to form different compositions than the natural landscape. Under this scenario, would the motivations and preferences of urbanresidents make it possible to conserve a sample of the local diversity in these spaces? To answer this question, we apply a semistructured survey to 100 homes that have a residential sidewalk garden in Santiago de Chile. Our results show that these gardens are perceived as an essential part of the home and its environment. We recognized three groups of citizens, namely, a utilitarian group (19 %), native group (21 %) and neutral group (60 %). The utilitarian group prefers to grow useful plants, such as for medicine or food. The neutral group does not indicate a preference for particular attributes of plants, which could be an indicator of the extinction of the experience with nature. Most of the participants do not know the origin of the species they grow.However, even when knowledge of native flora is limited (X¯ = 0.96; max = 3.0), citizens recognize the intrinsic value of these species and would be willing to conserve them in their gardens (X¯ = 4.35; max = 7.0). This willingness is also motivated by the set of benefits provided by native plants (e.g., ornamental, ecological, structural or emotional). Greater knowledge of native flora in the native group can be attributed to familiarity; therefore, the presence of these species in residential sidewalk gardens could encourage preferences and decisions aimed at promoting the conservation of local plant diversity. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH},

	abstract = {Rivers are important ecosystem services providers in southern Chile; however, the microbiology of most rivers are understudied. This is particularly true for phosphorus (P) recycling by bacterial activity. Here, we studied the physicochemical properties, P contents, phosphomonoesterase (Pase) activities, and bacterial Pase genes (phoD, phoC, and phoX) in Chilean river sediments (Imperial and Toltén rivers, Chile) collected in sites with less and more degrees of anthropogenic influence during the summer and winter seasons. The richness, diversity, composition, and predicted function of the bacterial communities were addressed, as well as the spatiotemporal relationships among P-associated parameters and bacterial communities. Our results showed spatiotemporal variations, highlighting higher values of the temperature, conductivity, nutrients (C, N, P), Pase activity, and Pase genes in sediments collected in sites more anthropogenized during summer. In contrast, higher richness, diversity, and abundance of total bacteria were found in sediments collected in winter. The phylum Proteobacteria and heterotrophy were the most relatively abundant bacterial taxa and predicted function, respectively. The differentiation among winter and summer sediments was also revealed and the relationships between bacterial community and P-associated parameters were confirmed. Our analysis also highlighted the positive relationship between Pase genes with Gemmataceae, Xanthomonadaceae, and Chitinophagaceae families, and between Pase activity and Po with Chromatiaceae and Desulfobacteraceae families. This study represents an initial investigation aimed to unravel the compositions and relationships of bacterial communities with P recycling in these sediments, which are threatened by anthropogenic activity (e.g., agriculture, industry, cities, etc.).

In Chile there is a lack of information about the sclerophyllous forest of the central zone, so in this article, we identify and quantify AMF spores in rhizospheric soil for the species Beilschmiedia miersii, Peumus boldus and Citronella mucronata and a site subject to ecological rehabilitation due to mining actions called "El Gallo", located in the coastal mountain range in the Valparaíso region. Rhizosphere samples of the three species and the site under rehabilitation were collected and subjected to morphometric analysis; sieving at 63, 149 and 297 µm and filtering, with spore counting in 50 g of rhizospheric soil in winter (August 2019) and summer (January 2020). The genera Glomus sp. and Acaulospora sp. were identified and it was determined that the density of AMF spores/50 g of soil at the El Gallo area in sieves of 149 and 297 µm was lower in comparison to the density presented by the rhizospheric soil samples of the three sclerophyllous species. These results establish a reference value with respect to the density of spores present for managing and improving the quantity and diversity of AMF in a sclerophyllous native forest species succession management. © 2022 Los Autores.},

	abstract = {Urbanization has negative consequences for the integrity of ecosystems and services they provide, by reducing their extent and quality in both aquatic and terrestrial environments. Few studies have explored how urban infrastructure expansion affects the spatial connectivity of coastal ecosystems by provoking their fragmentation and loss. Here we explore changes in the spatial connectivity of coastal ecosystems due to urbanization, analyzing ecosystem extent and concatenation with urban infrastructures (shared perimeter) in four bays of the Coquimbo region of northern Chile (from 29°S to 32°S) as model systems. Increase in natural-to-urban concatenation patterns were observed in most urbanized bays; sandy beaches and wetlands were the habitats most connected with urban infrastructures like roads and coastal artificial defenses. Availability of ecosystem services is compromised by progressive loss of natural connectivity and poor governance structure, which seems to confer high vulnerability to urbanized bays with future urban expansion. Complementary actions are proposed to reduce the vulnerability of coastal urban systems, considering 1) investment in nature-based infrastructures for coastal defenses, 2) restoration-rehabilitation of natural (remnant) urban ecosystems and eco-engineering of current artificial infrastructures, focusing on reestablishment of biodiversity patterns and habitat connectivity, and 3) limitation of coastal town and village expansion. Management strategies can improve coastal adaptation to natural hazards, stabilizing changes in the natural-urban concatenation mosaic present in coastal urban systems like bays. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Phylogenetic analyses categorize seven genotypes of citrus tristeza virus (CTV). The symptoms caused by this pathogen, their expression and severity are influenced by CTV genotypes, host species, cultivars, and infected host rootstocks. This study aimed to verify how populations of Chilean CTV isolates changed following inoculation from infected sweet orange to Mexican lime trees, and to determine if CTV genotype populations influenced transmission efficiency via Aphis gossypii. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction showed variation in genotypes of populations of CTV in Mexican lime, after graft inoculations using infected sweet orange chip-buds. Severe genotypes (VT) were detected after inoculation of mild isolate CTV populations (T30). The T30 donor populations also reduced transmissibility via A. gossypii; however, these results may not be conclusive due to mixture with the VT genotype. There is evidence of high rates of virus acquisition by this aphid species, but also low transmission efficiency, which may partially explain the historical absence of tristeza epidemics in Chile. © 2022.

	abstract = {Urban vegetation is generally exposed to adverse environmental conditions, such as high temperatures, compacted soils, low fertility, and a high pollutant concentration. The influence of biophysical and social factors on the survival and condition of trees and nontrees was analyzed using a census of plants in 37 green spaces of the Metropolitan Region of Santiago de Chile (MRS) several years after their establishment. The tree survival rate was higher (77%) than that of other species (24%). Survival was primarily explained by municipality management and species selection, but the relevance of these factors differed between trees and nontrees. Species with low water requirements outperformed species that were more sensitive to water stress. A high mechanical damage rate was observed, with 91% of trees showing severe or medium damage. Soil quality was better than expected, with a bulk density less than 1.0 g m-3 and moderate and high levels of P, and only 8% of sites had low K levels. The N content was highly variable, but most of the sites had levels greater than 20 mg kg-1, which indicates a trend of accumulation that is consistent with urban soils. More in-depth studies are required to establish the factors that explain plant survival in public spaces of the MRS, and irrigation monitoring is especially needed. © 2020, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Facultad de Agronomia e Ingenieria Forestal.

	abstract = {In field surveys, environmental variables influence whether an observer is able to re-cord an animal present at a given site. Despite the growing interest in the study of birds in urban ecosystems, the effect of environmental variables on the probability of detection has been scarcely explored. To provide scientific evidence that contributes to an adequate assessment of birds in urban environments, we evaluated the effect of noise, tree cover, and time of the day on the probability of bird detection in the city of Santiago, Chile. At 35 sites, we sampled four points that varied in noise levels. At each point, we recorded birds using distance sampling and measured noise levels as well as habitat attributes. We used the N-mixture model to model detection probability for six bird species: Zenaida auriculata, Elaenia albiceps, Troglodytes aedon, Turdus falcklandii, Zonotrichia capensis, and Passer domesticus. Noise exhibited a negative effect on the probability of detection of E. albiceps and P. domesticus. Tree cover had a negative effect on the probability of detection of T. falcklandii and Z. auriculata. The probability of detection of E. albiceps, P. domesticus and Z. auriculata was higher early in the morning and decreased considerably toward noon. For all six species the probability of detection was very low at distances more than 30 meters from the observer, indicating that corrections for imperfect detection may be necessary when surveys involve greater distances. Our results showed that it is necessary to consider the species-specific effect of environmental variables, which can affect the detection of birds in urban ecosystems. © 2022, Aves Argentinas - Asociacion Ornitologica del Plata.

	abstract = {The first introduction of a predator of olive black scale in 1903 marked the start of biocontrol in Chile. In 1915 the Ministry of Agriculture began a programme of introduction of beneficial organisms and since then approximately 200 species of beneficial insects have been introduced into the country. Many complete and permanent successes were obtained in the period 1900-1969 and examples are control of: olive black scale; scales in grapevine, citrus, berries, avocado and other fruit; mealybugs in citrus, grapevine, avocado and other fruit; and woolly apple aphid in apple. The use of microbial control agents started in the 1950s and numerous microorganisms have since been collected, identified and mass produced to control pests and diseases. Weed biocontrol began in Chile in the 1950s with successful classical biocontrol of St John’s wort with a phytophagous weevil, followed in the 1970s by using a plant pathogenic fungus for control of Rubus ulmifolius (zarzamora) and in the 1980s-1990s by releasing phytophagous weevils, moths and mites for control of gorse weed. An important large project executed during the 1970s and 1980s resulted in classical biocontrol of several virus-transmitting aphid species on thousands of hectares of wheat and barley. In forestry, parasitoids have been introduced for classical biocontrol of European pine shoot moth and of the sirex wood wasp in pine, and the eucalyptus psyllid in eucalyptus on vast areas. Currently, there are many commercial and governmental research initiatives for predators, parasitoids, entomopathogenic fungi and nematodes, and with bacteria and fungi for pest and disease control. © CAB International 2020.},

	abstract = {Diptera is one of the most speciose groups within Insecta, but there are deep gaps in knowledge of the South American faunas. Conopidae, also known as thick-headed flies, inhabit many habitats around the world, and are particularly diverse in the Neotropical region. Despite this, southern South American species of this group are poorly known and many genera are under-represented in museum collections. Only four Neotropical species of Myopa are known, three from Mexico and one from Chile. In this study we describe two new species: Myopa nebulosa sp. nov. distributed from northern Chile to the Maule region of central Chile, and Myopa bozinovici sp. nov. from Mediterranean ecosystems of central Chile. We also re-describe the conspicuous species Myopa metallica Camras and provide an updated key to all Neotropical species of this genus. The natural history of these species is unknown. Myopa species are not abundant and their habitats may be threatened by land change use. Copyright © 2020 Magnolia Press},

	abstract = {Invasive alien species generate adverse ecological, economic and social impacts in the invaded area. This is particularly alarming as the establishment of alien species shows no sign of saturation worldwide. Among invasive alien species, social wasps of the Vespidae family are well known to negatively impact the biodiversity and economy in the invaded areas. In 2020, an established population of the Oriental Hornet (Vespa orientalis L.) was detected in central Chile. This finding represents the first successful establishment of an insect of the genus Vespa in South America and rises an alarm about its potential spread in the Americas. Here, we performed an ecological niche modelling approach using Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and literature occurrences for V. orientalis and a set of environmental variables, to identify the suitable areas for the species outside its native range. The highest suitability values were predicted mostly in warm temperate regions and some arid regions of the world, with humid subtropical, Mediterranean, semi-arid or desert climates. In the Americas, we identified four main regions as moderately or highly suitable for the oriental hornet: the Gulf of Mexico and some areas in western California in the USA, central west Chile and the north-western region of Argentina. When we complemented GBIF occurrences with data from the literature, the potential areas of invasions became broader. Based on our results, we recommend the implementation of early warning monitoring schemes including citizen science initiatives to prevent the invasion of the oriental hornet. © 2021, Sociedade Entomológica do Brasil.},

	abstract = {Alerce (Fitzroya cupressoides (Mol.) Johnst.) and Guaitecas cypress (Pilgerodendron uviferum (Don) Florin) are two of the three closely-related species of conifers in the Cupressaceae that are endemic to southern Chile and Argentina. Both are listed in Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Fauna and Flora (CITES). The presence or absence of nodular (conspicuously pitted) end walls in the parenchyma cells provide good diagnostic characters to separate the two species wood anatomically, but the latter is sometimes difficult to distinguish. Therefore, a collaborative project was designed to study the chemical-molecular expression of these species by analyzing the heartwood using DART TOFMS (Direct Analysis in Real-Time (DART) Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (TOFMS). This study compares the anatomical features of heartwood for both species and demonstrates that anatomy in conjunction with chemistry can separate them. DART TOFMS analysis combined with PCA was able to unequivocally determine taxonomic source with a statistical certainty of 99%. The mass spectra results obtained from heartwood demonstrated that identification is feasible after a few seconds, using a very small sample. DART TOFMS is a robust tool for reliable species identification and is useful to identify the taxonomic source of finished products or timber that are suspected of being illegally harvested. © International Association of Wood Anatomists, 2020},

	abstract = {Background Plant species diversity may be seriously threatened in ecotone zones under global climate change. Therefore, keeping updated inventories of indicator species seems to be a good strategy for monitoring wild areas located in these strips. The database comes from an inventory of climbers and vascular epiphytes conducted in the Cerro Ñielol Natural Monument, a small protected area (89 hectares) located in Chile's Mediterraneantemperate phytogeographic region, within the boundaries of the city of Temuco, La Araucaína Region. The data represent the update of the first inventory carried out between 1980 and 1984. In this current contribution, data collection was carried out in 27 quadrats using the trails as transects. The data provide the record of 45 species (16 climbers, 15 epiphytes and 10 trees), including two accidental epiphytes (Acer psudoplatanus L. and Gavilea odoratissima (L.) Endl. ex Griseb.), two species that can be found as epiphytes or terricolous (Hymenophyllum tunbrigense (L.) Sm. and Nertera granadensis (Mutis ex L.f.) Druce) and one species (Chusquea quila Kunth) that can be found as terricolous and climber. Species of interest were recorded on live trees (n = 51), snags (n = 9), stumps (n = 4), fallen log (n = 5) and on the forest soil (n = 17). The most abundant climbers were Hydrangea serratifolia (Hook. & Arn.) F. Phil. (n = 77 stems), Lapageria rosea Ruiz & Pav. (n = 70 stems), Raukaua valdiviensis (Gay) Frodin (n = 48 stems) and Cissus striata Ruiz & Pav. (n = 33 stems). In contrast, the most abundant epiphytes were Hymenophyllum plicatum Kaulf. (n = 1728 fronds) and Hymenophyllum tunbrigense (L.) Sm. (n = 2375 fronds). These latter two species represent the highest frequency and abundance in the whole inventory, respectively. Several ecosystem traits are, in fact, new reports since the first inventory was conducted in 1980-1984; for example, the presence of the filmy fern Hymenophyllum tunbrigense, the record of the climber Elytropus chilensis, fallen logs or the species-host relationship. Accordingly, the database is made available in this manuscript. New information This study updates the climbers and vascular epiphyte species list in the Cerro Ñielol Natural Monument, a small patch of forest under severe anthropogenic pressure. This protected area is characterised by floristic elements of the Mediterranean and temperate phytogeographic region of Chile, in a zone where forests have been severely deforested. The database includes the record of 45 species – including six species that were not recorded in the first inventory – in 211 records. The main novelty of this contribution is the systematic classification of species, on ten traits rarely reported in a floristic inventory: (i) species taxonomic identity (as usual), (ii) species abundance (number of stems and fronds), (iii) habit (herb, shrub, subshrub, tree), (iv) growth form (accidental epiphyte, epiphyte, vine, liana, terricolous), (v) climbing mechanism (tendrils, adhesive roots, twining, scrambling), (vi) microhabitat (fallen log, footpath slope, soil, stump, trunk), (vii) host species (where appropriate), (viii) host condition (live, woody debris, snag), (ix) host diameter at breast height (DBH) and (x) target species found over 2.3 m on trees. Thirty years after the first inventory conducted between 1980 and 1984, the climber assemblage has remained relatively stable over time, although there are some differences in species composition. Specifically, the climber Elytropus chilensis are recorded in the current inventory, but the Mitraria coccinea (recorded in the first inventory) is not present. On the other hand, the epiphyte assemblage showed an increase in the species richness of filmy ferns, with five previously unrecorded species: Hymenophyllum cuneatum, H. dicranotrichum, H. pectinatum, H. peltatum and H. tunbrigense. One of the novel features was the presence of Sarmienta scandens and Synammia feuillei on a Pinus radiata D. Don tree. Additionally, the introduced species Acer pseudoplatanus is included, which is new to the Chilean vascular plant catalogue. All these data are available in the present manuscript. © 2021, Biodiversity Data Journal. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) often cohabite at interfaces shared by humans and wildlife, interacting with wild canids as predators, prey, competitors and reservoirs of several multi-host pathogens, such as canid-borne micro and macro parasites that could impact on wildlife, livestock and public health. However, spatio-temporal patterns of indirect interactions as promoters of pathogen transfer between domestic and wild canids are largely unknown. In this study, we used camera traps to describe the activity patterns and habitat use of dogs, chilla (Lycalopex griseus) and culpeo (Lycalopex culpaeus) foxes and identify the local-scale factors that may affect the frequency of dog-fox interactions through an anthropization gradient of the Coquimbo region, Chile. We assessed local-scale variables that may predict the number of interactions between dogs and foxes, and compared the time interval between dog-culpeo and dog-chilla interactions. Our findings suggested that closeness to urbanized zones predicts the frequency of indirect interactions between dogs and foxes. We found higher number of dog-fox interactions (60 interactions) at a periurban site adjacent to two coastal towns (Tongoy and Guanaqueros), compared to other two more undisturbed sites (12 interactions) increasingly distanced from urbanized areas. We showed that dogs interacted more frequently with chilla foxes (57 interactions) than with culpeo foxes (15 interactions), and the first interaction type occurred almost exclusively at the periurban site, where dogs and chillas were more frequently detected than in the other sites. We detected a marked temporal segregation between dogs and foxes, but dog-chilla interactions resulted in shorter time intervals (2.5 median days) compared to dog-culpeo interactions (7.6 median days), suggesting a higher potential risk of pathogen spillover between the first species pairing. Based on previous studies, we suggest periurban zones may constitute a potential focus of pathogen exposure between dog and fox populations in the study area. Our research contributes to improving the knowledge on the spatio-temporal patterns of interspecific contact between invasive and native carnivores within the context of multi-host pathogen dynamics. Our outcomes will inform theoretical epidemiological models designed to predict and minimize the contact risk between domestic and threatened species, guiding effective control strategies at the wildlife-domestic interface. © Copyright © 2021 Hernández, Manqui, Mejías and Acosta-Jamett.},

	abstract = {Vacant land in growing cities is commonly targeted for development because it is perceived as wasted land that provides no benefit for people or nature. However, vacant sites might contribute to biodiversity conservation. To help inform biodiversity-sensitive urban development, we examined whether vacant land provided suitable habitat for birds in the Latin American city of Santiago, Chile - a growing capital city located in a Mediterranean ecosystem identified as a global biodiversity hotspot. We posed the following questions: How do species richness and abundance of native and exotic birds vary among vacant lands, urban parks and residential areas? And does vacant land support a different bird community compared with urban parks and residential areas? We found that vacant lands helped conserve local birds. Vacant lands exhibited high species richness and abundance of native birds, and maintained significantly fewer exotic species than urban parks and residential areas. In addition, vacant lands supported a different bird community than urban parks and residential areas, including several native birds associated with grasslands and rural areas that are rare in the city. Although vegetation in vacant land was dominated by exotic herbaceous plants, they provided important resources for native birds. Our findings demonstrate that vacant land covered by spontaneous vegetation provides habitat for native birds. Given that vacant lands offer opportunities for biodiversity conservation and to connect urban residents with nature close to home, we discuss strategies to help maintain the benefits provided by vacant lands through urban design, land use planning and urban growth policies. © 2020 Elsevier GmbH},

	abstract = {Species of the genus Platanus are widely distributed around the globe, due to their ornamental use. Although there are 10 valid species, an undetermined number of hybrids have been generated from them. Therefore, in different cities where these taxa have been planted-including Chilean cities-the diversity and taxonomic representation of Platanus is confusing and controversial. Through a PCR-based procedure on the LEAFY gene (LFYi2), an informative gene to identify Platanus species, we analyzed the diversity of the genus in Santiago, measuring also its representation. We sampled 269 Platanus trees distributed in streets and avenues of Santiago, showing that there are at least seven taxa, including the species P. occidentalis and P. orientalis, and five hybrid taxa; one of them is P. × hispanica, while the other four have no discernible origin from Leafy-i2 (here called Platanus A, Platanus B, Platanus C and Platanus D). In terms of representation, the set of hybrid taxa accumulated 84.7% of the trees sampled; while P. orientalis and P. occidentalis together accumulated 15.3% of the trees. Of the species, P. orientalis was the most frequent (14.9%), while among the hybrids, the most frequent was Platanus A (40.8%); in contrast, P. × hispanica represented a low proportion of the sample (1.9%). These results confirm the presence of P. occidentalis, P. orientalis and P. × hispanica in Santiago; however, the cumulative representation of these three taxa (17.2%) is lower than that of undetermined hybrids (82.8%). The taxonomic recognition and representation of Platanus specimens in Santiago is an important tool for projecting future urban tree planting efforts, especially in view of the ecosystem services provided by them. © 2022 The author(s).

	abstract = {Killer whales (Orcinus orca) are marine apex predators distributed across the world’s oceans. In the last 40 years, researchers have increasingly differentiated killer whales into ecotypes based on genetics, morphology, behaviour, acoustic repertoire, habitat, and trophic ecology. While killer whale ecotypes in the Northern Hemisphere are well studied, the recognition of distinct killer whale forms in the Southern Hemisphere is mainly limited to Antarctic waters. Although present in less studied regions, such as along the Atacama Desert coast in the Southeast Pacific Ocean, limited information is available regarding their biology or trophic ecology. Herein, multiple lines of evidence are presented for killer whale predation on marine mammals in northern Chile. Using information from systematic boat-based surveys, whale-watching tour surveys, and reports from fishermen/citizen scientists, 19 killer whale sightings are reported along the coast of northern Chile (from the Arica and Parinacota region in the north to the Atacama region in the south). Killer whales were photo-identified as corresponding to the Southern Hemisphere Type A-like ecotype according to their dorsal fin shape and white eye patch. One killer whale pod, which included two males, one female, one juvenile, and one calf, was resighted six times from 2016 to 2021 in northern Chile and was observed hunting South American sea lions (Otaria flavescens), dusky dolphins (Lagenorhynchus obscurus), and long-beaked common dolphins (Delphinus cf. capensis). Killer whales were observed taking advantage of large aggregations of sea lions associated with the off-shore purse-seine fishery. Adult killer whales used the hulls of fishing vessels to prevent sea lions from escaping. Photo-identification analysis of a fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus) catalogue from Mejillones Peninsula showed that 2.6% of all identified whales had apparent rake marks from killer whale teeth on their dorsal fins. These data show that Type A-like killer whales in northern Chile prey on several species of marine mammals © 2022, Aquatic Mammals. All Rights Reserved.},

	abstract = {The relationship between leaf area index (LAI), ultraviolet radiation (UV) and temperature measured at 1.5 meters (T°1.5) and at ground level (T°s) was studied, in three urban forest areas of Talca City, Chile. Circular plots with different tree projection coverage areas were defined for the registration of the T° and UV data. Measurements between 13 and 14 hours were performed and distributed for each year season, while the LAI was obtained with a single record per season; the selection zones and measurement points were done by a non-probabilistic method. The results showed that LAI, as a factor, had a statistical significance effect for UV, T°1.5 and T°s, with 0.0081; 0.0058 and 0.0334 respectively (P <0.05), demonstrating that LAI is related as indicator of the mitigating function of urban forest, regardless of season of the year. The correlations were positive, although weak, as they failed to robustly explain their relationship with the measured variables; and LAI did not fully explain the variability that it has with T°s and T°1.5 (r = 0.47 and r = 0.48 respectively), the same for UV (r = 0.38). In the context studied, it was not possible to determine that the LAI is an index that explains the variability presented, obtaining R2 of 22.15%, 23.28% and 14.47% for T°s, T°1,5 and UV, respectively, so the tree species and the characteristics associated with the plots, would explain the high dispersion of the results. The presence of trees favors the condition of T ° and UV in the city pedestrian displacements. © 2021 University of Sao Paolo. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Urbanization effects have been studied all over the world, documenting impact in species richness, abundances and changes in species communities. Birds have been broadly used as study models. In general, urbanization affects birds, reducing species richness, especially in the urban core, and increasing species richness in areas with intermediate levels of disturbance, such as suburbs. Urbanization also changes species assemblages depending on urban characteristics and resources available, creating habitats for different species. Even when more than half of the cities in the world are on the coast, the effects of urbanization on habitat use of terrestrial and marine birds in coastal urban environments has received little attention. We hypothesized that coastal cities would present different bird diversity in modified marine areas and modified inland areas as terrestrial and marine ecosystems coexist. We predict that modified marine areas will have higher species richness than modified inland areas and natural marine areas. For bird assemblages, we expect to find similar species compositions between sites with similar habitat characteristics more than closeness. We compare habitat use of marine and terrestrial avifauna in the human-modified coastal city of Valparaiso, Chile, characterized by a range of urban developments within city boundaries. We specifically compare corrected bird abundance in six different possible habitats for birds, according to distance to the coast, and human influence. Bird counts (50 m fixed radius) were conducted in winter and spring of 2019. Bird species richness and abundances, corrected by the probability of detection, were estimated. Additionally, species composition and occupancy of bird species in those habitats were calculated. Results show that coastal urban cities can provide different habitats for bird species. Modified inland habitats differ from semi-natural inland habitats and from the modified beaches in species richness and species composition. Environmental heterogeneity in coastal cities seems to allow the coexistence of marine and terrestrial bird species, showing differences in species richness and bird assemblages for marine-inland environments and natural- modified habitats. Results highlight the need to consider these factors for urban planning in order to conserve bird diversity in coastal urban areas. Copyright © 2022 Graells, Celis-Diez, Corcoran and Gelcich.},

	abstract = {Background: Wild edible plants are species that are not cultivated but can be consumed as food. These plants may exhibit the highest taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity within urban floras, since they have a longer history of use associated with humans than non-edible plants. Also, because biodiversity is strongly associated with biomass, edible plants plant might show higher productivity (biomass per site) than non-edible plants. Questions: Is taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity of wild edible plants higher than non-edibles within urban areas? Is the alpha-biodiversity of wild edible plants positively related to biomass productivity in urban areas? Study sites and years of study: Cities of the coastal Mediterranean-type ecosystem, central Chile, 2015 and 2016. Methods: We characterized the taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity of urban flora differentiating wild edible and non-edible plants. Then, we assessed whether alpha-diversity of assemblages is related to their biomass productivity. Results: Both taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity were higher for edibles than non-edible plants. For edible plants, biomass was positively related to species richness and negatively with the mean phylogenetic diversity (MPD, a measure of evolutionary relationship among plants within an assemblage). Conclusions: Species richness is a suitable proxy to estimate wild edible plant diversity and their biomass in cities surpassing other proxies, such as phylogenetic diversity. Negative effect of MPD on biomass suggests that only a subgroup of related plants, possibly highly adapted to urban conditions, contribute to edible plant production. The distinction between wild edible and non-edible plants offers a better understanding of the assembly rules and biodiversity-biomass relationship within urban floras. Keywords: Assembly mechanism, community ecology, phylogenetic diversity, urban flora, wild edible plants. Resumen Antecedentes: Las plantas silvestres comestibles son especies no cultivadas que pueden utilizarse como alimento. Estas pueden exhibir una mayor diversidad taxonómica y filogenética dentro de las floras urbanas, debido a un historial de uso más largo asociado con los humanos que las plantas no-comestibles. Debido a la relación biodiversidad-biomasa, las plantas comestibles pueden mostrar una mayor productividad que las no-comestibles. Preguntas: ¿Es la diversidad taxonómica y filogenética de las plantas silvestres comestibles mayor que la de las no-comestibles en áreas urbanas? ¿La alfa-biodiversidad de las plantas comestibles está relacionada positivamente con la productividad de biomasa en áreas urbanas? Sitios de estudio y años: Ciudades del ecosistema mediterráneo costero, Chile central, 2015 y 2016. Métodos: Caracterizamos la diversidad taxonómica y filogenética de la flora urbana diferenciando plantas silvestres comestibles y no-comestibles, evaluando si la alfa-diversidad de los ensambles está relacionada con su productividad. Resultados: La diversidad taxonómica y filogenética fue mayor para las plantas comestibles que las no-comestibles. Para las comestibles, la biomasa se relacionó positivamente con la riqueza de especies y negativamente con la diversidad filogenética media (MPD). Conclusiones: La riqueza de especies es un proxy adecuado para estimar la diversidad de plantas silvestres comestibles y su biomasa en las ciudades. El efecto negativo de MPD sobre la biomasa sugiere que solo un subgrupo de plantas relacionadas contribuye a la producción de plantas comestibles. La distinción entre plantas silvestres comestibles y no-comestibles ofrece una mejor comprensión de las reglas de ensamblaje y la relación biodiversidad-biomasa en la flora urbana. © 2021 Sociedad Botanica de Mexico, A.C.

	abstract = {The taruka is one of the least known deer species of the world. Its range includes the northern Andean mountains in Chile, where their relationship with Aymara peasants is conflictive because of crop raiding. The aim of this study is to understand the nature of this conflict in Chile, and identify socio-ecological features that may explain it. Data of different sampling dates from 2003 to 2011 of night transects on roads, crop examination, interviews and direct sighting of tarukas were used to understand its ecology and relationship with local peasants. Peasants interviewed (n=47) cultivated mainly corn (85.1%) and alfalfa (74.5%) in small farms and 83% of them raise livestock. The conflict is widespread in Parinacota Province, where tarukas effectively consume crops, mainly abandoned alfalfa at night. The occurrence of crop raiding is not positively correlated with dry season as expected. However crop consumption is low (10.3% average of damaged plants in crop plots). In Del Tamarugal Province only 29.4% of peasants manifested conflict with tarukas but they did report conflict with other ungulates. Day sightings showed 78 tarukas in 34 encounters during 59 days. Night surveys yielded 11.6 ± 7.4 tarukas/ survey, sighted only in alfalfa plots. Aymara agriculture feeds tarukas and is declining because of rural-urban migration. The conflict must be considered in the conservation strategy of the species. © 2021 The author(s). Gayana and 2021 Universidad de Concepción.},

	abstract = {The Nutria or Coypu (Myocastor coypus Molina, 1782) is one of the invasive vertebrate species residing in and near some aquatic habitats of Palestine (27,000 km2) and other neighboring countries. The animal was said to be introduced from Chile, South America, into Palestine by fish farmers for fur production in the early 1950s. It was released into many aquatic ecosystems for economic and ecological reasons, but it was proved to cause damage to agriculture, wildlife and other human properties. Hence, the current descriptive study comes to give notes on the occurrence and dangers of the invasive Nutria in Palestine. The study, which lasted three years (July 2018 - June 2021), was based on many procedures to satisfy its purposes. Frequent field visits, direct observations and photography, meetings and discussions with stakeholders, and fellow-up of local news and social media sites were common tools used throughout the succeeding stages of the study. The current study shows that the Nutria happens in great parts of northern and central and coastal Palestine, including the Hula Lake, the Jordan River and its tributaries, and many valleys of Palestine. Specimens of the animal caught from northern Wadi Arabah and Negev Desert as well. In spite of their polluted waters, Wadi Al-Muqatta in northern Jenin, West Bank, and the lower Jordan River harbor a population the invasive Nutria. The Nutria does not occur in the Gaza Strip and the three live specimens of the animal incidentally fell into fishing nets in 1997 seemed to come from Ashkelon; the closest city in the Palestinian land occupied by Israel since 1948. As far as the dangers of the invasive Nutria in Palestine are concerned, they include herbivory and destruction of aquatic plants, attack and feeding on agricultural crops, creation of "eat-outs" areas which is harmful to many freshwater animals including the Caspian Terrapin (Mauremys caspica), use of and disturbance to many water birds nests, competition with the Eurasian Otter (Lutra lutra), damages of burrowing behavior of Nutria to banks along waterways and other human properties, and aggressiveness towards humans and pets. Many measures have been applied to control the Nutria in Palestine. The role of the Palestinian carnivorous mammals in controlling the Nutria should be respected. © 2021 Israa University.

	abstract = {Monk Parakeets (Myiopsitta monachus) are medium‐sized parrots that due to international pet trade currently exist as invasive species in 19 countries globally. Such is the case of Chile, where Monk Parakeets have thrived in the city of Santiago. Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia spp. are worldwide distributed gastrointestinal parasites whose potential hosts include birds and humans. The present study sought to determine the presence of these pathogens in Monk Parakeets from Santiago. During the austral summers of 2017 and 2018, 207 Monk Parakeet nestlings were captured, and fecal samples were studied via microscopical analyses. Environmental data related to the trees in which the nestlings were captured were analyzed to establish the existence of infection clusters. Associations between spatial clusters, environmental variables, and the presence or absence of these pathogens were explored. In total, 33 samples were positive to the presence of one or both protozoa. Of the 33, Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts were detected in 10 nestlings (30%) while Giardia spp. cysts were detected in 25 (76%). Two nestlings presented poly‐parasitism (6%). Statistical analyses established pruned trees as a potential protective factor against infection with these parasites. The present study corresponds to the second report of Cryptosporidium spp. in Monk Parakeets in Chile and the first worldwide report of Giardia spp. in these birds, emphasizing Monk Parakeet’s potential role as a reservoir and pathogen disseminator, especially in urban environments. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {A new species of Anthomyzidae (Diptera), viz., Mumetopia interfeles Roháček sp. nov. (both sexes), is described from Chile, based on a large series collected from a small grassy area (consisting of a non-native species, Hordeum murinum L.) among houses in the city of Valparaíso. Its systematic affiliation, phylogenetic relationships, and biology are discussed. Cases of mass occurrence of adult Anthomyzidae, particularly those in anthropogenic habitats, are reviewed and general features of them discussed. A phylogenetic hypothesis is proposed for the relationships of the new species and the Chamaebosca group of genera within Anthomyzidae (64 species in dataset), based on Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood analyses of seven DNA markers (12S, 16S, 28S, COI, COII, CytB, ITS2). Taxonomic limits of the genus Mumetopia Melander, 1913 are discussed. Based on a new molecular hypothesis and a previous cladistic analysis of morphological data (Roháček & Barber 2009), a broadened, better-supported concept of Mumetopia (s. str.) is proposed to include M. interfeles sp. nov. (and its unnamed relatives) and externally aberrant, undescribed species endemic to the Juan Fernández Islands. Apart from Anthomyzidae (M. interfeles sp. nov. only), the community of Diptera associated with H. murinum was dominated by phytophagous Chloropidae: Ceratobarys sacculicornis (Enderlein, 1911) occurred in extremely high numbers similar to those of M. interfeles sp. nov., while the less abundant Opetiophora sp. represents the first record of the genus from South America. © 2021, Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle.

Studying their very considerable presence in Concepción (Chile) provided a unique opportunity to learn more about the different patterns of sociality and territoriality exhibited by the dog species. Via a set of case studies, we examined the behavior of urban dogs, adopting an ethnographic methodology. This yielded findings of the dogs’ cognitive, social and spatial adjustment abilities, i.e., their territorialities. Our hypothesis was validated: We found numerous types of sociability, we confirmed the presence of two previously established categories: family dogs (pets, guard dogs and beggars’ dogs) and stray dogs (dogs almost entirely unused to humans, aggressive dogs at the far end of the campus and feral dogs in the woods). We also identified three new ones: familiar stray dogs in packs (dogs both spatially and socially close to humans), pet-stray dogs (i.e., village dogs interacting closely with people) and free-roaming pet dogs. We conclude that an ongoing two-way bond between humans and animals allowed these dogs to became part of a city’s urban identity and explains the stray dogs’ plasticity in terms of adapting to the diversified urban habitat. We postulate that it was the human culture and range of urban areas in Concepción that gave rise to this unique diversity of sociospatial positioning and level of adjustment (e.g., dogs crossing crosswalks). © 2020 by the authors.

This article reports 51 records of presences, sightings, and livestock attacks of Puma concolor, a large-sized felid, collected from 2012 to 2020 across the O’Higgins region in central Chile. Puma records were concentrated in the east of the region in the Andes Range and foothills (90%). The number of puma records is higher in the last four to six years than in previously studied years. Of the 51 records, 23.5% are between 0 and 999 m from the nearest human settlement (classified as very close), 25.5% are between 1000 and 4999 m (moderately close), and 51% are over 5000 m (distant). Most of the sightings are recorded in the summer (35%) and spring (29%). We identify an area of approximately 9000 km2 of suitable habitat as the most probable corridor effectively connecting pumas moving between eastern and western areas, encompassing the Angostura de Paine mountain range. Our results contribute to the understanding of the presence and movements of P. concolor near urban areas and human settlements, confirming their persistence in and adaptation to human-dominated landscapes.

The yield of chiltepin fruits collected under greenhouse conditions was higher than mezquite stands (2.34-times). Likewise, fruits from greenhouse had a higher pH (6.0), the wild type and mezquite stands (pH = 5.5) chiltepin fruits. The numbers of seeds of chiltepin fruits cultivated in greenhouse and mezquite stands conditions were higher in comparison to wild type fruits (1.75-fold). However, mezquite stands and wild type chiltepin fruits showed 1.25 times higher acidity (% citric acid) than fruits cultivated in greenhouse conditions. Furthermore, the chiltepin fruit from mezquite stands was higher in the +a (red) color parameter (2.36-times) than wild type fruits. These results showed that chiltepin fruits from mezquite stands presented the best physicochemical properties and red color, thus, this growth condition could serve as germplasm banks for the production of seed form Capsicum annuum var. glabriusculum of good quality, and for the further establishment of new plantations of chiltepin species in the northwestern of Mexico. © 2020, Universidad de Tarapaca.

	abstract = {Mediterranean coastal ecosystems are major tourist destinations that support intensive real estate business developments. However, these areas are also important as biodiversity hotspots. Coastal spiders have been poorly studied as indicators of habitat disturbance, especially those that depend on certain environmental variables. Plesiolena bonneti is a trapdoor spider that exclusively inhabits the coastal areas of central Chile (i. e., the Coquimbo region, 29°57′S, 71°20′W), intensely affected by habitat loss due to urbanization associated with tourist destinations. The main aim of this work was to establish, preliminary, the conservation status of P. bonneti supported by different environmental variables that define the activity period and occurrence of P. bonneti males and its distribution area. Trapdoor spiders are rare and difficult to observe in the field. and therefore, we used datasets obtained from citizen science to establish the period of activity, and environmental variables (maximum temperature, relative humidity, and month of observation) as predictors of its occurrence. Moreover, since it lives in an area perturbed by urbanization, we propose a preliminary conservation status using the IUCN Red List. We found that the species is observed significantly more in the austral autumn and that its occurrence (65 % of variability through Akaike weight) depends on maximum temperatures of 17 °C and relative humidity above 90 %. Its current distribution is mainly coastal, between the Atacama and Coquimbo regions. We propose that this species should be considered a vulnerable species. The increased observation of male P. bonneti post-rains may be driven by a physiological response to avoid water loss, which would coincide with the reproductive period. As the largest number of records are observed in coastal urban areas, we propose two simple management measures: the creation of nature reserves within the city, and an educational program for this spider. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH},

	abstract = {The ecology of leeches worldwide has been scarcely studied, with the ecology of Neotropical leeches remaining highly unknown. Americobdella valdiviana, an endemic, carnivorous, and giant leech that inhabits the Valdivian evergreen forest in southern Chile, an ecosystem that has experienced an increase in its net loss from 3.6% to 12% in the last decades due to various human activities. Here, we combined citizen science with species distribution models (SDM) to analyze (i) the effect of habitat variables with the abundance A. valdiviana, (ii) the distribution range, (iii) the habitat loss and fragmentation of A. valdiviana, and (iv) their conservation status. First, we asked each user or scientist for the observed relative abundance and a series of environmental variables, which were then correlated by using Generalized Linear Models. Then, distribution ranges were estimated using SDM, which was combined with multiannual forest cover maps to identify habitat loss and fragmentation between 2000 and 2018. Finally, we used IUCN criteria to evaluate the conservation status of this species. Abundance was related mainly to the canopy coverage, while suitability was positively associated to temperature seasonality and canopy cover. Suitability was higher in forests with levels of primary productivity. We found that the north and center zones of the species range experienced high habitat loss and fragmentation. Under IUCN Red List criteria, we qualified this species as endangered. Our results support that the combination of citizen science, SDM, and spatial analysis at local and biogeographical scales can inform conservation actions of poorly known and threatened macroinvertebrate fauna. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The use of wood exterior siding in Chile is mostly seen in rural areas, being Radiata pine overlaps the most common product, generally treated as is stipulated in the Chilean building code of the General Ordinance on Urban Development and Construction (OGUC), for nondurable species. Typically, preservative treatment is done with Copper Chromium and Arsenic (CCA); however, other alternatives are available, although less known, but equally effective and regulated, such as Copper azoles, Borates and Light Organic Solvent Preservative (LOSP). Preservatives based on organic solvents are applied in only few treatments plants, via vacuum-vacuum, to timber products that are exported mainly to the United States and Australia, being sidings one of the greater value-added product. Under proper treatment, installation, construction and appropriated maintenance, the LOSP manufacturer offer a 30-year limited guarantee to the homeowners against biodeterioration of the treated wood. Due to the minimal experiences locally in the durability of woods for exterior use treated with LOSP, this survey monitored exterior siding installed in a house located on the coast of the Chile's Fifth Region. The type of siding used is known as Shiplap and was treated with a LOSP preservative and after installation was painted with high gloss synthetic enamel as was recommended by the siding manufacturer. After six years, the surveyed sidings remain in perfect condition and do not present fungi or xylophagous organisms attack. A slight discoloration of the paint on the West face (highest sun exposure) was detected, along with cracking in the lower areas, near cuts and nails. These problems may be mitigated through proper sealing of affected areas. This treatment has a higher initial cost than conventional alternatives, but its performance under adverse conditions and its low carbon footprint makes it highly recommendable. © WCTE 2021.

	abstract = {Fascioliasis is a widely distributed parasitic zoonosis caused by the trematode Fasciola hepatica that affects livestock production and generates high economic losses. In Chilean authorised abattoirs, the infected livestock livers are condemned during the veterinary inspection. This study aims to evaluate the prevalence of fascioliasis in Chile from 2014 to 2016 and also monthly from 2002 to 2015 in livestock (cattle, pig, sheep, horse and goat) slaughtered in abattoirs of La Araucanía region, southern Chile. To do this, the available records on abattoirs provided by the sanitary authority were analysed. A descriptive statistics and trend analysis of the data by jointpoint regression was carried out. The Biobío and La Araucanía regions registered the highest levels of parasitosis in the country recording levels of 59.18 and 44.74%, respectively, and presented 50.03% of the liver condemnation rate in cattle. During the study period, a total of 2,239,164 animals were slaughtered and 40.59% infected livers with F. hepatica were condemned in the 9 existing abattoirs of La Araucanía region. The abattoirs located in the cities of Temuco (51.43%) and Angol (65.09%) recorded the highest percentages of fascioliasis. The cattle species recorded the highest number of slaughtered animals and liver condemnation (54.52%). The presence of the parasite was recorded annually and monthly and it was possible to observe a slight increase in fascioliasis over the years. This study provides updated information on the fascioliasis prevalence in the country and the dynamics of condemnation in endemic areas such as La Araucanía region, which could contribute to the control and prevention of this zoonosis. © 2022 Universidad Austral de Chile.

	abstract = {Amphibian chytridiomycosis, caused by the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), has caused the greatest known loss of biodiversity due to an infectious disease. We used Bd infection data from quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assays of amphibian skin swabs collected across Chile during 2008–2018 to model Bd occurrence with the aim to determine bioclimatic and anthropogenic variables associated with Bd infection. Also, we used Bd presence/absence records to identify geographical Bd high-risk areas and compare Bd prevalence and infection loads between amphibian families, ecoregions, and host ecology. Data comprised 4155 Bd-specific qPCR assays from 162 locations across a latitudinal gradient of 3700 km (18º to 51ºS). Results showed a significant clustering of Bd associated with urban centres and anthropogenically highly disturbed ecosystems in central-south Chile. Both Bd prevalence and Bd infection loads were higher in aquatic than terrestrial amphibian species. Our model indicated positive associations of Bd prevalence with altitude, temperature, precipitation and human-modified landscapes. Also, we found that macroscale drivers, such as land use change and climate, shape the occurrence of Bd at the landscape level. Our study provides with new evidence that can improve the effectiveness of strategies to mitigate biodiversity loss due to amphibian chytridiomycosis. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Black skimmers (Rynchops niger) visit the coast of Chile during the Southern summer, being observed in flocks of different sizes, mainly in coastal wetlands. Through the joint use of a database of citizen science observations together with our long-term monitoring, we estimate that the population size for the species in Chile reaches 10,227 individuals. Three sites congregate more than 50% of the population, these sites are the estuaries of Mataquito and Itata river, and Tubul. The analysis of the relative abundance throughout the year for four geographic macrozones would reflect the movement of the species on the coasts of Chile. The Northern zone shows an abundance peak in November with the arrival of individuals, yet its return strategy keeps not being so clear. The Central-North and Central zones of the country show two peaks in the arrival and departure of individuals, suggesting a rather transit use. The existence of a single peak in February, in addition to the highest concentrations of individuals, would indicate that the Central-Southern and Southern areas of the country would potentially be the destination for a large part of the population of black skimmers. The radiotelemetry monitoring of individuals allowed the detection of movement of individuals between a network of coastal wetlands. These displacements would occur frequently throughout the season and both north and southbound. This study provides relevant information for the status of the species in Chile, a country that is habitat for a potentially significant proportion of the cinerascens subspecies during the non-breeding period. © 2020 The author(s).

	abstract = {We studied the temporal variation of the soil seed banks in the urban lots of Santiago, Chile. As most of the plants that emerge from the seed banks in lots are also found in open habitats and are easily germinable, we hypothesize that the seed banks in lots are highly dynamic and short-lived, with the bank depleted every year during the germination season to be reloaded with new seeds during the next seed dispersal period. In each 20 lots for two year (2017 and 2018), 9 soil samples were collected. These samples were obtained from three sampling points randomly distributed across the plots. The seed bank was estimated by seed germination in soil samples placed in plastic trays. The samples of all the lots were stratified at 2 °C by 3 months before sowing. In order to record the seed persistence, soil of three lots watered in 2017 for six months were dried and maintained under dark and non-watered conditions until re-sowing in autumn 2018. To determine if the seeds present cold-associated germination triggers, soils of five lots were maintained under dark conditions for 3 months (soils without cold stratification) for comparison with soils with cold stratification of the same lots. The above-ground plants were recorded in all lots for both years. Forty plant species were recorded in soil bank. The total emerged seedling densities ranged between 7,944 (2017) to 3,700 seedlings m-2 (2018). Species per lot varied between 17 and 7 during 2017, and between 14 and 3 during 2018. In five lots, seedling densities were not statistically different between cold stratified soil at 2 ° C and non-stratified. In three lots with re-sown soil, seedling density of the first sowing (4,096 seedlings m-2) was significantly higher than second sowing (201 seedlings m-2). Thirty-seven plant species were recorded in the above-ground vegetation during 2017 and 42 species in 2018. Species frequency of the seed bank was positively correlated with species frequency of above-ground vegetation. Concluding, the bank is highly dynamic, short-lived, and is depleted every year during the germination season, which begins with effective rainfalls, would be reloaded with seeds during the seed dispersal period. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH},

	abstract = {Rapid urban growth poses the global challenge of mitigating urbanization impacts on biodiversity. The amount and spatial arrangement of vegetation could help managers and urban planners improve habitat conditions for fauna; however, whether aggregated patterns of trees and shrubs promote greater diversity of wildlife in urban areas remains poorly understood. To provide empirical evidence to help planning and management of urban vegetation for native fauna, we evaluated the influence of amount and spatial arrangement of woody vegetation cover on species diversity, richness and abundance of native birds in a growing city located in a biodiversity hotspot. We first mapped woody vegetation cover at a high spatial resolution using satellite images (WorldView-2, 0.45 m resolution) in the city of Santiago, Chile. Then, we performed a stratified random sampling approach to select 118 urban landscapes (1 km2 size) with different amounts and aggregation of woody cover. All selected urban landscapes were surveyed for birds during reproductive and non-reproductive seasons. We found the amount of woody cover positively influenced native birds, including different diet guilds. Species diversity, richness and abundance of all native, insectivorous and omnivorous birds, and the abundance of granivorous birds increased with the amount of woody cover in the urban landscape. Contrary to our hypothesis, spatial aggregation of woody cover exhibited mainly no-effect or negative effects on native birds. Our findings demonstrate prevailing positive effects of the amount of woody cover on native birds, and mostly no benefit of aggregation at 1 km2 scale. Therefore, both scattered and aggregated trees and shrubs contributed to support native birds in the city. Targeting high levels of woody cover, planting and preserving trees and shrubs (regardless of whether they aggregate or scatter across the urban landscape), will promote greater native bird diversity, mitigate negative impacts of urbanization on local birds, and help restore people-nature interactions in cities. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH},

This limitation for urban inhabitants leads to differences in the knowledge and use of wild plants compared to rural inhabitants. Hypothesis: Rural and urban populations tend to share a similar knowledge of plants and use similar plants species when easy access to natural landscapes is available. Study site and years of study: Rural and urban area of Curarrehue, La Araucanía region (southern Chile), 2017. Methods: The use patterns of wild edible plants (WEPs) and wild medicinal plants (WMPs) were compared between the rural and urban population of Curarrehue. We evaluated the number of WEPs and WMPs gathered, their richness and diversity, the most important gathering environments and the way in which knowledge was acquired. Results: No differences were observed in the use of wild plants between the populations, except for the richness of WMPs. The WEPs were gathered mainly from the forest by both populations, and in the case of the WMPs, from forest and disturbed areas. The knowledge was acquired mainly through relatives by gathering plants from forest areas. Conclusions: Access to natural environments is key to preserving traditional practices and contributes to reducing gaps in the knowledge and use of wild plants between local rural and urban populations. © 2021 Sociedad Botanica de Mexico, A.C.

A. trijuga is a polymorphic species with pinnate leaves with 3-5 pairs of leaflets with forage properties, used as firewood and widely distributed in Argentina and Chile. Background knowledge on the topic refers only to the cytogenetics of populations in the Cuyo Region. The objective of this work is to establish the vegetative, histochemical and cytogenetic micrographic parameters to characterize A. trijuga in populations of Northwestern Argentina. Five individuals were randomly collected from populations located in Jujuy, Salta and Tucumán. The material was fixed in FAA and herborized; traditional anatomical, histochemical and cytogenetic techniques were applied. The results evidenced paripinnateleaves, microphylls, with leaflets of entire leaf blade, symmetrical, obovate, and pinnate-camptodromous-eucamptodromous venation. Amphistomatic leaflets, pubescent in both epidermis, with eglandular and glandular trichomes the last being of three types; isodiametric to rectangular epidermal cells, with straight to curved walls with striated cuticle; anomocytic, hemibrachyparacytic, brachyparacytic, amphibrachyparacytic, hemi-amphibrachyparacytic, and hemiamphicyclocytic stomata; equilateral mesophyll; collateral vascular bundles with a sclerenchyma cap towards the phloem surrounded by parenchyma sheath. Petiole subcircular with eglandular and glandular trichomes identical to those of the foliolate lamina; 2-3 subepidermal layers of palisade chlorenchyma; five collat deseral vascular bundles.

	abstract = {Biodiversity-sensitive cities can contribute to reconnect humans with nature and halt global biodiversity loss. Achieving biodiversity-sensitive cities is challenging, especially in regions threatened by growing urbanization. To inform urban management and planning in a global biodiversity hotspot, we conducted a multi-scale assessment of drivers of Neotropical birds in the capital city of Santiago de Chile. We investigate the influence of local and landscape variables on native bird species richness and abundance. We surveyed birds and vegetation in 449 sampling points distributed across the city. Native bird species richness was greater in areas with greater shrub and woody vegetation cover at the local scale. Native bird species richness was also greater with high vegetation density in the surrounding landscape and near to an urban boundary. Native birds were abundant in areas with large woody vegetation cover at both local and landscape scales, high vegetation density in the surrounding landscape, near to an urban park and near to an urban boundary. Additive effects of vegetation at different spatial scales suggest that combining local and landscape management, planning and design will be best to preserve native birds in a large city. Although native birds are species rich and abundant near the urban fringe and decrease towards the interior of the city, local-scale management of habitat encouraging shrub and tree planting and landscape-scale actions such as targeting high levels of vegetation (including woody cover) and providing a well-distributed network of urban parks will help sustain native birds across the city. Greening actions at local and landscape-scale will contribute to achieving biodiversity-sensitive cities, providing benefits for people and nature. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH},

Expanding habitat usage by humans today is likely one of the major factors influencing animal habitat use and behavior. Rapa Nui, a remote Chilean island located at the easternmost corner of the Polynesian Triangle, hosts a population of green turtles, Chelonia mydas, that have been monitored by citizen scientists since 2010. Through the collaborative work of divers from the local community and professional scientists, we describe C. mydas daily underwater resting and foraging patterns in Rapa Nui. We identified 15 individuals by monitoring 19 specific resting locations within the Rapa Nui coral reef. A high level of spatial fidelity for specific resting sites was observed in 12 turtles that used the same location for as long as 5 yrs. Moreover, we observed a clear temporal pattern in the daily use of resting habitats, with 79% of resting activity occurring during low tide. In contrast, the daily peak in feeding activity was associated with high tides. Abiotic characteristics (depth and cardinal orientation) of resting sites did not show significant relationships. The information from this study will inform management of the Rapa Nui Multiple Uses Coastal Marine Protected Area to increase the protection of marine turtles residing at this isolated Pacific Island. © 2020 Chelonian Research Foundation.},

	abstract = {Insects use biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) as chemical cues to find their host plants and colonize them. Studies of olfactory responses have reported that BVOCs released by host plants attract whiteflies. The citrus woolly whitefly, Aleurothrixus floccosus (Maskell) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) is a serious foliar pest, infesting citrus orchards at the Pica Oasis, Tarapacá Region, Chile. We studied the attractant behavior of A. floccosus toward BVOCs emitted from lime (Citrus ×aurantiifolia (Christm.) Swingle), mandarin (Citrus reticulata Blanco), and tangelo (Citrus reticulata × Citrus ×paradisi Macfad.) shoots. We collected volatiles from living plants using dynamic headspace technique for 24 h. The BVOCs released by the Citrus species were collected on Porapak Q traps and analyzed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The chemical analysis revealed differences in abundances of monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes and aldehydes; thus, D-limonene (33.44%) was the most abundant compound in lime and significantly higher than mandarin and tangelo. On the other hand, sabinene (12.36%), nonanal (28.06%) and caryophyllene (22.97%) were more abundant in mandarin. Tangelo showed high abundance of β-phellandrene (17.01%), nonanal (17.87%) and caryophyllene (16.01%). In the two-choice bioassays, we found 13.5% and 17.1% more A. floccosus females in lime than in mandarin and tangelo, respectively. Our findings show that the volatile profile of ‘Limón de Pica’, C. aurantiifolia, elicits the strongest attractive behavior of A. floccosus females in the olfactometry experiments. © 2021, Instituto de Investigaciones Agropecuarias, INIA.

	abstract = {The tiger crab Aegla concepcionensis Schmitt, 1942 (Decapoda, Aeglidae) is a threatened freshwater decapod, endemic of Chile, with significant gaps in knowledge about its biology and ecology. The aim of this work was to contribute to the knowledge of the ecology of A. concepcionensis, through the extension of its known distribution range, recorded in a new type of ecosystem, and the description of the physicochemistry, vegetation and benthic macroinvertebrate and microalgal communities of those sites, which provides information about habitat use of the species. Our results show the presence of A. concepcionensis until 270 km south of the previously described range and reveal that the species inhabits streams and lakes. A. concepcionensis is associated to environments with cold and temperate waters, well oxygenated, with neutral pH and low conductivity, and characterized by low anthropic intervention, which is reflected in the high proportion of native riverine plant species and the high diversity of macroinvertebrate and microalgal benthic communities. We conclude that the previously restricted known distribution range of this species was mainly due to low sampling effort or misidentifications. Our results indicate that anthropic intervention should be avoided or minimized in the distribution area of A. concepcionensis, especially in those areas associated with urban expansion and touristic activities in streams and lakes. © Asociación Ibérica de Limnología, Madrid.

	abstract = {Biological invasion is one of the main threats to native biodiversity. For a species to become invasive, it must be voluntarily or involuntarily introduced by humans into a nonnative habitat. Mammals were among first taxa to be introduced worldwide for game, meat, and labor, yet the number of species introduced in the Neotropics remains unknown. In this data set, we make available occurrence and abundance data on mammal species that (1) transposed a geographical barrier and (2) were voluntarily or involuntarily introduced by humans into the Neotropics. Our data set is composed of 73,738 historical and current georeferenced records on alien mammal species of which around 96% correspond to occurrence data on 77 species belonging to eight orders and 26 families. Data cover 26 continental countries in the Neotropics, ranging from Mexico and its frontier regions (southern Florida and coastal-central Florida in the southeast United States) to Argentina, Paraguay, Chile, and Uruguay, and the 13 countries of Caribbean islands. Our data set also includes neotropical species (e.g., Callithrix sp., Myocastor coypus, Nasua nasua) considered alien in particular areas of Neotropics. The most numerous species in terms of records are from Bos sp. (n = 37,782), Sus scrofa (n = 6,730), and Canis familiaris (n = 10,084); 17 species were represented by only one record (e.g., Syncerus caffer, Cervus timorensis, Cervus unicolor, Canis latrans). Primates have the highest number of species in the data set (n = 20 species), partly because of uncertainties regarding taxonomic identification of the genera Callithrix, which includes the species Callithrix aurita, Callithrix flaviceps, Callithrix geoffroyi, Callithrix jacchus, Callithrix kuhlii, Callithrix penicillata, and their hybrids. This unique data set will be a valuable source of information on invasion risk assessments, biodiversity redistribution and conservation-related research. There are no copyright restrictions.

	abstract = {Urbanization and climate change are two inevitable megatrends of this century. Knowledge about the growth responses of urban trees to climate is of utmost importance towards future management of green infrastructure with the aim of a sustainable provision of the environmental ecosystem services. Using tree-ring records, this study analyzed growth response to climate by stem diameter at breast height (DBH) of 1178 trees in seven large cities worldwide, including Aesculus hippocastanum L. in Munich; Platanus × hispanica Münchh. in Paris; Quercus nigra L. in Houston; Quercus robur L. in Cape Town; Robinia pseudoacacia L. in Santiago de Chile, Munich, and Würzburg; and Tilia cordata Mill. in Berlin, Munich, and Würzburg. Climate was characterized following the de Martonne aridity index (DMI). Overall, trees showed an 8.3% lower DBH under arid than humid climate at the age of 100. Drought-tolerant tree species were overall not affected by climate. However, R. pseudoacacia showed a lower diameter when growing in semi-dry than humid climate. In contrast, drought-sensitive tree species were negatively affected by arid climate. Moreover, the effect of drought years on annual diameter increment was assessed. P. × hispanica and R. pseudoacacia appeared as the most drought-resistant species. The highest sensitivity to drought was detected in T. cordata and Q. robur. A. hippocastanum and Q. nigra showed a lower diameter growth during drought events, followed by a fast recovery. This study’s findings may contribute to a better understanding of urban tree growth reactions to climate, aiming for sustainable planning and management of urban trees. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {We analyzed the potential historical influence of cities in the South American Southern Cone. To do so, we described temporal pa?erns of cities’ foundations; we built maps of potential influence of urban centers and characterized ecoregions according to their history of ‘influential; cities. In Chile, Paraguay and Argentina, cities were mostly founded prior to 1650 (early Spanish colonization) and after 1850 (consolidation of national states). In Uruguay and Brazil, colonization occurred mostly between 1650 and 1850. The bimodal pa?ern observed in the western side of the study area is also reflected in the Monte, Arid Chaco and Humid Chaco ecoregions. The center-west and northwest of the area include ecoregions which are environmentally very different (Puna, Yungas, Chilean matorral), but have a common early history of cities’ influence during the 16th century. In contrast, the ecoregions of the Patagonia show low and late urban influence, starting in the 19th century. The ecoregions of the east (Pampas and Atlantic forest) are characterized by intermediate colonization dates. Among the ecological processes potentially associated with these pa?erns of cities foundation, we identify the following: 1) history of agriculture and, most importantly, livestock herbivory and its ecological consequences, 2) short term perturbations with long-lasting effects (e.g., pulses of fire activity, human diseases), 3) the delayed effect of early cities foundations as cause of current urban size, which in turns influences ecological transitions and exotic species invasions, and 4) the emergence of novel ‘social-ecological; niches in areas of late colonization (e.g., Mennonites in the Chaco). This study provides an integrative and promising methodological approach to analyze the ecological history of land-based teleconnections, a key for the functioning of the Anthropocene. © 2021, Asociacion Argentina de Ecologia.

	abstract = {The breeding of exotic pets has become a popular practice in Chile and, within this group of animals, small mammals such as guinea pigs and hedgehogs have gained importance due to their docile behaviour. The most common exotic hedgehog species in Chile is the African pygmy hedgehog (Atelerix albiventris). It has been reported that these pets are reservoirs of some zoonotic pathogens, among which Salmonella enterica constitutes an important threat for the owners. This study aimed to detect the presence of Salmonella strains in faeces from hedgehogs (Atelerix albiventris) admitted to a veterinary clinic in Santiago, Chile, and to characterise the antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolated strains. From 200 animals sampled, S. enterica was detected in 5 hedgehogs, corresponding to serotypes Muenchen (2), Infantis (2) and IV43:z4,z23:- (1). Furthermore, phenotypic antimicrobial resistance was determined in all subsp. enterica isolates. These results suggest that in Chile these exotic pets constitute a potential hazard for public health, therefore, supporting educational campaigns about basic biosecurity measures is necessary, mostly aimed at pet owners and risk groups. © 2021 Universidad Austral de Chile.

	abstract = {Citizen science initiatives contain a large volume of observations that can be useful to address ecological questions for a wide array of organisms. However, one limitation of citizen science data is the potential for species misidentification. Although recent studies have shown that citizen science data are relatively accurate for many taxa, the effect of misidentification errors in hard-to-identify species remains poorly explored. If misidentification events occur at large scales, ecological estimates can be compromised. Here, we show that misidentifications contained in citizen science databases biased phenological estimates in a pair of migratory and partially overlapping Neotropical flycatchers: the Chilean Elaenia Elaenia chilensis and the Small-billed Elaenia Elaenia parvirostris. We reviewed and re-classified 4399 photos of these species from Argentina, Chile and Uruguay. We found that overall identification accuracy was high (c. 90%) for both species when they were allopatric, but dramatically low for Small-billed Elaenia during autumn migration (from 28.6% to 84.6%) because migrating individuals of Chilean Elaenia were systematically reported as Small-billed. The phenological estimates for both Elaenias were biased due to the large number of misidentifications concentrated towards the autumn migration period. These errors caused a 1-week advancement in the estimated arrival, and a 2-week delay in the estimated departure for Small-billed Elaenia. For Chilean Elaenia, errors caused a 1-week delay for the estimated spring peak passage and underestimation of the magnitude of the autumn passage. Our results highlight the importance of performing critical assessments of records when using citizen science databases to describe ecological patterns in species that are hard to identify. The large volume of information provided by citizen science initiatives is useful to describe spatio-temporal patterns in birds, particularly in those of poorly known regions. However, to further enhance the usefulness of such databases, it is imperative actively to post-process and contrast patterns derived from documented (and undocumented) records, with a special focus on misidentifications. This will only be possible through a thorough review of the documented data, together with an intimate understanding of the natural history of the study species. © 2021 British Ornithologists' Union.},

	abstract = {Maytenus boaria Molina (Celastraceae) is an evergreen native tree which is widely distributed in Chile. It has a high economic potential due to its medicinal value, among others. Despite this, biological information about the species is scarce and often confusing. The objective of the study was to broaden the knowledge about reproductive aspects and the sexual system of M. boaria, along with its modular architecture and pheno- morphology. The study was conducted from August through December of 2016, with adults plants (n=17) selected in urban areas of the Región Metropolitana. A pollination test was performed and the sex of the flowers of each selected tree was identified. In addition, a pheno-morphological diagram of the species was made through the modular interpretation of its architecture and the identification of its phenophases. Results showed that M. boaria is a dioecious and andromonoecious species; it has a low autonomous autogamy and is non-apomictic species that needs pollination vectors for seed production. It has four architectural modules in its crown: Dolichoblast of apical bud, dolichoblast of axillary bud, inflorescence and reproductive temporary brachyblasts which are distributed in two architectonic units. The floral biology and pheno-morphology of this species indicate that it would be in an evolutionary process regarding the functionality of hermaphroditic flowers, which has been proposed as an intermediate step from hermaphroditism to dioecy. Further knowledge of these topics will allow for a better understanding of the autoecology of the species in order to have an appropriate and productive management of it. © 2020 The author(s).

	abstract = {Monitoring the general public's support toward wildlife species is a strategy to identify whether a specific human–wildlife conflict (HWC) is escalating or de-escalating over time. The support can change due to multiple factors, such as mass media news of HWC or providing information about ecological traits of a species. Methods such as the rating scale (RS) and the allocation of a fixed amount of money (money allocation [MA]) have been used in the human–wildlife dimension as a proxy to measure support toward wildlife species. We compared these two methods' capacity to assess the general public's support changes toward wildlife species in an experimental design setting. Face-to-face interviews were applied among urban dwellers (n: 359) in Valdivia, Chile. In each interview, the support toward 12 wildlife species was elicited using an RS and MA methods, on two occasions, before and after disclosing ecological traits of the species. The results indicate that the MA grouped the wildlife species based on shared ecological traits, information disclosed to the participants, while the RS did not obtain the same results. Specifically, the MA identified an increase and decrease of support toward the wildlife species, and the RS only an increment of support. These results could be partly explained due to the conceptual foundation of each method. The MA was designed to elicit preferences in a constrained choice, while the RS measures attitudes. As a constrained choice, the MA does allow maximum support to be given to one species only if all other species are left unsupported, while in the RS, it is possible to provide maximum support for all species. The mentioned characteristics of the MA make it more suitable than the RS when the objective is to identify support changes. © 2022 The Authors.

Potential treatments include many domestic animal therapeutics, such as Adequan®, which is used widely in dogs and horses. However, clinical reports have described hemorrhagic diatheses in a variety of avian species treated with varying doses and administration frequency of Adequan. This study investigated the hypocoagulability associated with parenteral administration of Adequan in avian species. Following a pilot dosing study in domestic chickens (Gallus gallus), citrated plasma from Chilean flamingos (Phoenicopterus chilensis) (n = 42) was spiked with Adequan to represent three dosing regimens (1 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg). The fibrinogen content of plasma samples was determined and thrombin-clotting times (TCTs) were compared for the untreated (control) and spiked flamingo samples. The TCT for control and 1-mg/kg spiked plasma were not significantly different; however, both 5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg spiked samples demonstrated significantly prolonged TCT (P-value < 0.0001) indicating hypocoagulability. These results support that Adequan given parenterally at 1 mg/kg can be utilized safely in clinical case management as an adjunctive treatment for osteoarthritis in flamingos and potentially other avian species. © 2022 by American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.},

	abstract = {Vacant lands are part of the informal greenspace and could maintain native fauna in urban ecosystems. To provide scientific evidence that promotes bird conservation in cities, we compared different bird community attributes among vacant lands, urban parks, and residential areas in the city of Santiago de Chile. For this, we estimated taxonomic diversity in the three land-use types, calculated the species richness and abundance (of total and native species, including three trophic guilds: granivores, insectivores, and omnivores) among land-use types, and evaluated the influence of habitat variables on bird species richness and abundance recorded. We found that vacant lands supported a diverse community, with low species dominance, and high species richness and abundance, comprised mainly by native granivorous and insectivorous birds. In contrast, birds with generalist diet (omnivores) reached high abundances in urban parks and residential areas. While parks and residential areas were dominated by a single omnivore species (Turdus falcklandii in parks and the exotic Passer domesticus in residential areas), a set of native species reached high abundances in vacant lands. These included granivorous birds (Sicalis luteola, Zenaida auriculata, and Zonotrichia capensis) and insectivorous birds (Tachycineta meyeni and Anthus correndera). Sites with a larger cover of herbaceous plants exhibited greater richness and abundance of native birds. In addition, sites with larger proportion of their area covered by bare ground exhibited greater abundance of native birds. Our results demonstrate that vacant lands maintain high bird diversity, as well as a high species richness and abundance of native birds with specialized diets (granivores and insectivores), offering new opportunities to conserve biodiversity in cities. © 2021 Neotropical Ornithological Society.

	abstract = {Urbanization causes a strong environmental impact involving habitat degradation, loss and fragmentation for multiple species. Because in Latin America urbanization commonly occurs in sites of high value for biodiversity, it is necessary to develop strategies to conserve biological communities in urban landscapes. In this paper, we summarize the main lessons learned in five years of empirical studies in the city of Santiago, capital of Chile, highlighting the main lessons to promote a city more sensitive with native birds. Our research shows that: (1) vegetation cover promotes greater species richness and abundance of native birds, and its benefits are evident at both local and landscape scales; (2) the urban forest is a key component to maintain native birds in the city which has positive effects on birds from different trophic guilds and limit the abundance of exotic birds Passer domesticus and Columba livia; (3) urban parks support more native birds than built-up areas and their benefits would spill over into neighboring areas; (4) the informal green space (vacant lots, uncultivated or abandoned land) maintains a great variety of native birds, including species that are not common in the city; and (5) it is important to preserve the natural vegetation around Santiago, since it is home to bird species endemic to Chile that are sensitive to land use change. We hope this synthesis will facilitate the implementation of our recommendations and, in the near future, we achieve more nature-friendly cities in Latin America. © 2022, Aves Argentinas - Asociacion Ornitologica del Plata.

	abstract = {Urban forests affect land surface temperature (LST) within a city due to the cooling effect of transpiration. The latter depends on tree health, but it can also be affected by the structure and composition of forest, as a mono-species environment may potentially worsen the health of urban forest. The following hypotheses are therefore proposed: a) greater tree diversity within urban forest results in lower LST at the city block scale; and b) the state of biotic disturbance of urban forest is negatively correlated with LST. The present research explores the relationship between urban forest tree diversity and health based on a survey of 38,950 individuals in the district of Providencia in the city of Santiago, Chile, and compares this information against LST data from the ASTER satellite instrument at the city block scale. The health of the urban forest was determined by expert knowledge means of a field survey that collected data concerning growth stage, phytosanitary state, and state of biotic disturbance. The first hypothesis could not be tested by the lack of urban tree diversity which showed strong domination of three species with more than 52 % of abundance (Robinia pseudoacacia, Platanus orientalis and Acer negundo). The second hypothesis was proved since the results revealed a positive and significant correlation between urban forest diversity and LST, with a Spearman's correlation coefficient of between 0.56 and 0.7. A positive and significant correlation of 0.55 was found between mean biotic disturbance (BDSm) and median LST (Med), indicating a direct relationship between higher LST and poorer urban forest health. A possible explanation is that, among the trees surveyed within the urban forest, the effect of biotic disturbance is greater than that of species diversity. As such, it may be concluded that planting of trees on city streets as a means of temperature moderation is made less effective if specimens are maintained in a poor general condition of health. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH},

	abstract = {Chile is a country that depends on the extraction and export of its natural resources. This phenomenon has exacerbated different processes of transformation and disturbance of natural and human ecosystems. Land use change has become a key factor for the transformation of ecosystems, causing consequences for biodiversity conservation. In this study, current and future (2030, 2050 and 2080) land use categories were evaluated. Land use projections were analysed together with models of ecosystem distribution in Chile under different climate scenarios, to finally analyse different dynamics of land use change within the protected areas system. In all the scenarios evaluated, land use projections showed an increase in the areas of industrial forest plantations and urban areas and a decrease in natural and agricultural areas could be expected. In relation to ecosystem modeling, vegetational formations located in the center and south of the country could be expected to decrease, while vegetational formations in the north and center of the country could extend their surface area. Inside Chile’s protected area network, anthropic disturbances are currently undergoing expansion, which could have consequences for ecosystems and protected areas located in the central and central–south zones of Chile. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Introduction and objectives: The genus Pilosella is native to Europe and Asia, but its species are successful invaders on most continents. These species form an agamic complex with common apomixis. Apomictic species hybridize and have different degree of residual sexuality. Main aim of this paper was to determine if interspecific hybridization already occurred in Patagonia. M&M: We analysed seed progeny collected at thirteen populations of Pilosella in southern Argentina and Chile. The taxonomic identity of plants, DNA ploidy level (using flow cytometry), chromosome number, reproduction, formation of parthenogenetic seeds and clonal identity (using isozyme phenotypes) were examined. Results: No mixed-species population was recorded. Two apomictic clones of P. officinarum (one pentaploid and the other hexaploid) were found in populations: eight were hexaploid and one was mixed in cytotype composition. A new species for Patagonia, the apomictic pentaploid P. caespitosa, was represented by plants from two Argentinean populations. Some of the progeny plants, cultivated from seeds sampled at three localities, represented seed-fertile aneuploids the morphology of which suggest a hybrid origin with P. officinarum as one of the parental species. Conclusions: The presence of seed-fertile, aneuploid and parthenogenetic hybrids among the cultivated plants signifies an increased risk of the formation of new hybridogeneous genotypes of Pilosella in southern Patagonia. © 2021.

	abstract = {Human-dominated environments alter the availability and quality of resources for many species, especially for scavengers that have large home ranges and plastic foraging behaviors that enable them to exploit novel resources. Along the western slope of the Andes, the modification of natural landscapes have resulted in significant declines in native prey, the introduction of non-native species, and an increase in the availability of anthropogenic resources. These factors have likely influenced the resources available to Andean condors (Vultur gryphus), however, data are lacking as to how condor's diet vary along their large latitudinal range. We evaluated differences in Andean condor diet along a ~2500 km latitudinal gradient in Chile from the heavily modified Central zone (32–34°S) to the more pristine Austral zone (44–56°S). We assessed diet composition through the identification of prey remains in condor pellets, and carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis of condor feathers and their primary prey identified from pellet analysis. Our results identified medium- and large-bodied domesticated mammals (ungulates) and introduced exotic species (lagomorphs) as common prey across the study area. Condors from the Central zone had the largest isotopic niche width, probably related to consumption of anthropogenic resources with distinctly high carbon isotope values indicative of C4-based foods likely acquired from landfills or corn-fed livestock. Isotopic niches for condors from the Southern and Austral zones almost completely overlapped. Andean condor diet is strongly influenced by local conditions determining differential access to prey sources. The high dependence of Andean condors on livestock across a large geographical area, and landfills in more (sub)urban areas, may help stabilize their populations via anthropogenic resources subsidies. Long-term dependence on such resources, however, may have health costs including contaminant exposure and greater mortality risk. These data will help identify potential threats related to resource availability and use, and better inform management and conservation decisions. © 2020},

	abstract = {The Cautín River is closely related with the economic development of Temuco city, (38°S; Chile). Existing knowledge of the Cautín River is limited to information about its biological characteristics as a reference for the evaluation and assessment of water quality. The object of this study was to develop taxonomic characterisation of the benthic macroinvertebrates along the main course of the Cautín River, and to study the community structure using correlation analysis between community parameters. To carry out this research, the macroinvertebrate community was studied in 10 sampling sites distributed along the main course of the river. The samples were taken in summer (1997 and 2000), when optimal hydrological conditions existed. Analysis of the samples showed that the benthic fauna was composed of 56 taxa, the dominant group being insects with 48 taxa. Three main sectors were recognised in the course of the Cautín River: high, middle and low. Each sector has restricted-distribution species, while other species are widely distributed along the river. These distribution patterns seem to be influenced by dissolved oxygen concentration, temperature, altitudinal distribution and anthropo-cultural activity, present at every sampling site. Finally, this research provides a first approach to the biology of the Cautín River. Further studies could be planned on the basis of this knowledge to investigate water quality indicators based on macroinvertebrate communities. © 2022, Instituto Internacional de Ecologia.

	abstract = {Gurltia paralysans (order Strongylida; family Angiostrongylidae) is a metastrongyloid parasite that causes chronic meningomyelitis in domestic cats in South America. The geographic distribution of G. paralysans includes rural and peri-urban areas of Chile and Argentina. However, feline gurltiosis has recently been reported in other South American countries, including Uruguay, Colombia, and Brazil, and was also recently reported in Tenerife, Canary Islands (Spain). Feline gurltiosis is increasingly detected in domestic cats in southern Chile and its apparent geographic range is also increasing, together with an awareness of the disease among veterinarians. The life cycle of the parasite is unknown, but is probably indirect, involving gastropods as the intermediate host, as in other metastrongyloid nematode species. The clinical signs of G. paralysans infection include progressive pelvic limb ataxia, paraparesis, paraplegia, faecal or urinary incontinence, and/or tail paralysis. A definitive diagnosis of feline gurltiosis is still challenging and only possible with necropsy, when adult G. paralysans nematodes are detected within the spinal cord vasculature, together with macroscopic lesions, and characteristic morphological features. A semi-nested PCR method was recently developed for the in vivo diagnosis of this neglected parasite. Current treatment options include macrocyclic lactones and mylbemicn oxime, but the prognosis is poor in severe cases. In this article, we review G. paralysans infection in cats, focusing on the diagnosis shortcomings and the future directions of research into its biology and the associated neurological disease. Comprehensive updates on the epidemiology and clinical features, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of feline gurltiosis are provided. © 2021 Universidad Austral de Chile. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The sustainable provision of pollination services in large regions of the Nearctic and Neotropics usually involves the coexistence of a rich assemblage of native bees and introduced bees in the same agroecosystem. This requires identifying biotic and abiotic conditions that improve the quality of semi-natural habitats surrounding agricultural crops aiming to enhance native bee survival. Here we unravel the contribution of habitat conditions, diversity of flowering plants, and honeybee abundance to the taxonomic diversity, flower visitation rates and functional trait distribution of native bees. We have selected three 1.2 km diameter experimental landscapes in a Mediterranean semi-arid agroecosystem of Central Chile, where wild bees, honeybees, and flowering plants were sampled in 83 10 × 10 m plots. The effects of eleven remote-sensing indices characterizing the habitat conditions, and their interactions with honeybee abundance have been analysed. Native bees were taxonomically richer in semi-natural habitats, with higher surface temperatures and near citrus crops. The flower visitation rates of native bees were positively affected by canopy closure and decreased in sites with a higher terrain slope. Highlands had lower honeybee abundance and native bees were more specialized. We found higher flower visitation rates of native bees on large patches with low abundance of honeybees and small patches with high abundance of honeybees. Visitation rate was also higher in sites with high flowering plant richness and with high abundance of honeybees. These findings suggest that native bees and honeybees differ in their habitat use and flowering resources. This partitioning may enhance, coexistence between these pollinator groups. We suggest that management of Mediterranean agroecosystems be focused on increasing forest canopy closure on the remnants of semi-natural habitats, while maintaining the flower diversity near crops and highlands. © 2020 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Global change drivers including eutrophication, hydrological disturbance, climate change, chemical pollution, overexploitation, invasive species, and land-use change are affecting the function and structure of freshwater ecosystems. South American freshwater ecosystems are especially threatened by the combination of rising human pressures on natural resources (i.e., water use, intensive agriculture, mining, deforestation, and afforestation) and the lack of adequate legislation and economic resources for environmental protection and restoration. We assess the state of freshwater ecosystems in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Uruguay, and Venezuela, focusing on broad categories of human-induced threats grouped into 5 categories: climate change, watershed stressors, hydrological alteration, channel modification, and biological stressors. For most countries, the most severe threats are related to land uses such as mining, agriculture, and urban expansion. Other threats relate to the abstraction or wasteful use of water and the intense regulation of flows, including the effects of large hydraulic infrastructure. There is also an increasing need to empower public organisations that focus on environmental protection, to update or develop an adequate regulatory and legal framework, to provide adequate funding for the implementation of environmental legislation, and not least to implement ecological rehabilitation. Implementation of these steps would reduce the threats to South American aquatic ecosystems and allow progress toward the sustainable development of this region in future decades. © 2021 International Society of Limnology (SIL).},

	abstract = {People’s perception on birds of prey is heavily influenced by its intrinsic value, utility, myths and superstitions. In particular, negative perceptions may encourage poaching and persecution of these birds, affecting their conservation status. One nocturnal raptor species widely distributed across the world is the Barn Owl (Tyto alba, Tytonidae). In Chile, this species has been recorded and studied exclusively in rural and sub-urban areas. However, in the city of Valdivia Barn owls exist within the city boundaries. In this study we documented the feeding habits of Barn owls nesting in urban settings of Valdivia, and we analyze the opinions of local neighbors toward the owls. To characterize the diet of owls, we collected all pellets found around their nesting tree on a monthly basis between August 2010 and August 2011. We interviewed the neighbors using a questionnaire that included questions about the utility, ethical or aesthetic value of the owl and the tree where they nested. Our results indicate that the main prey of the Barn Owl was the Long-tailed Colilargo (Oligoryzomys longicaudatus). The neighbors’ perception was favorable to the Barn Owl primarily for aesthetic and ethical reasons, and not utilitarian reasons. Our results suggest that people perception in urban areas is different than in rural areas, where previous studies showed the prevalence of utilitarian values. This positive perception represents a great potential to promote conservation and environmental education in the city, creating a link between people and the natural elements they have in their environment. © 2017, Universidad de Concepcion.

	abstract = {Aim: Biological invasions are one of the major threats to biodiversity. Usually highly disturbed anthropogenic habitats favour invasion by alien species such as the coccinellid Harmonia axyridis. The spread and impact of this species has been documented in Europe and North America, but no information exists for South America. The aims of this study were to: (1) document the process of invasion of H. axyridis in Chile, (2) compare the abundance of H. axyridis in different habitats with varying degrees of disturbance and (3) assess change in the coccinellid assemblages in alfalfa fields over the 6 years following invasion. Location: Chile. Methods: The spread of H. axyridis was estimated using information from citizen scientists alongside records from the National Pest Surveillance System. The abundance of H. axyridis in different habitat types and of all coccinellids in alfalfa fields was assessed using yellow sticky traps. In alfalfa, the variations in species richness, Shannon and Simpson diversity and equitability indices through time were compared. Results: Harmonia axyridis has rapidly increased in distribution: there have been 1875 records along 2863 km up to 2015 following the first observation in 2008 from Central Chile. The records span from sea level to 3200 m a.s.l. in the Andes. It has spread at an average rate of 184.8 km per year, preferentially colonizing disturbed habitats, but also invading native habitats. In alfalfa, it is particularly abundant and has become the dominant species, with a concomitant decrease in species richness and diversity of co-occurring species. Main conclusion: Citizen science, alongside professional surveillance, has provided an effective method for studying invasion by H. axyridis, which is now well established and distributed across Chile. The rate of spread has been dramatic and the associated changes to the coccinellid community could disrupt the functioning, and ultimately resilience, of invaded ecosystems. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

To assess if this area is regularly used by the species, we encouraged volunteers to be part of a Citizen Science project in Chile to conduct listening points at night, allowing us to gather records from extensive areas. In 2 years, we collected 80 records of Upland Sandpiper from Arica to La Serena, confirming that northern Chile is part of the regular route. This migration strategy might be a result of the current winds, which blow from east to west in March and April on the South American continent and from south to north following the Pacific coast. These results change our understanding of the Upland Sandpiper migration through South America, adding a new, important area where the species must be considered for energetic project assessments. © 2018 Wilson Ornithological Society.

	abstract = {Aim: Extinctions of species and subspecific taxa in hotspots of biodiversity deserve special attention. After more than 40 years of major efforts, estimates of extinct plant taxa in California seem to be somewhat stabilized. The time is ripe for an attempt to critically evaluate our current knowledge of plant extinctions in California and make a comparison with other countries with mediterranean-type climates. Location: California. Methods: Besides species-specific studies and personal communications, major databases and state floras were consulted. Results: Compared with all numbers published earlier, the current analysis ended with smaller numbers of globally extinct plant species and taxa (13 and 17, respectively) and larger numbers of species and taxa extinct in California, but still present in at least one other state or country (15 and 15). For each species, life form, habitat, year of the last collection and assumed drivers of extinction are listed. Main conclusions: Most of the presumed extinct taxa were originally present in one or two counties and often are known from only one or a very few collections. Therefore, the most robust generalization regarding factors contributing to taxon extinctions is a small range size and a low original abundance. Most of the presumed globally extinct taxa were originally present in lowlands where most of the human population and habitat destruction are concentrated. Taxa limited to special habitats, like wetlands, seem to be more predisposed to extinction. Among assumed drivers of plant extinction, agriculture, urbanization and development in general are the most often cited possibilities. Compared with other countries with mediterranean-type climates, the extinction rate of vascular plants in California is lower than in Israel, comparable with the Cape Province of South Africa, Western Australia and continental Mediterranean European countries, and higher than in Chile. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

	abstract = {Recent studies have highlighted the threat that climate change poses to species, as areas of climatic suitability contract or shift across the landscape. North American Neotropical long-distant migrant bird species present a unique problem compared to sedentary species because climate change may differ significantly across their breeding and wintering grounds. Studying the potential future distributions of these birds is challenging on many levels, including the fact that our understanding of the wintering grounds of these species is quite poor. To address this issue, we analyse available eBird data during the winter season in the Western Hemisphere in an effort to further promote and direct citizen science efforts to focus on areas that are climatically undersampled. We used Mobility-Oriented Parity (MOP) to understand the areas where climates are most dissimilar from climates sampled by existing eBird checklists, creating a map that ranks the western hemisphere at a 10 km resolution for climatic sampling during the winter season. We found that parts of Mexico and Central America, areas of Colombia, almost the entire Amazon Basin, coastal Peru and Chile, and northern Argentina are climatically undersampled. As a test case, we then used the map of survey priorities to simulate additional sampling in Colombia and recalculated the rankings. Guiding additional sampling with the priorities reduced climate dissimilarities between sampled and unsampled grid cells more than when additional sampling expanded in proportion to current sampling efforts or based on geographic undersampling. Analyses of sampling coverage in environmental space, such as this, will be a useful tool for targeting monitoring effort for bird species. © 2021 ASTM International. All rights reserved.},

A total of 80 taxa were identified based on morphocytological attributes, being the Streptophyta-Zygnematophyceae the most abundant group with a dominance of Desmidiaceae (47 species), follow by Cyanobacteria (14), Euglenophyceae (12), Chlorophyta-Chlorophyceae (5), and Dinophyceae and Ochrophyta-Raphidophyceae with one taxon each group. The genera with the higher number of species were Cosmarium (12), Closterium (11) and Staurastrum (8). The pH ranged from 5.0 to 6.1 during the recollection period. Most of the desmids species identified (70.2 %) are from acidophilus environments, 48.6 % are indicators of mesotrophy and 21.6% of meso-oligotrophic habitats. Twenty-four species are cited for the first time for Chile. Although the study was restricted to a relatively small area, the results suggest that a great diversity of microalgae might be also found in similar ecological areas within the country. © 2019 The author(s).},

	abstract = {Seed dispersal by endozoochory is an important mechanism promoting the spread of exotic fleshy-fruit plants. Although the invasiveness of glossy privet (Ligustrum lucidum W.T. Aiton) in several regions has been associated with the presence of disperser birds, only a few studies have examined their seed germination after dispersal. In Central Chile, the privet grown is an ornamental species, but to date, it has not been observed to settle in natural or seminatural habitats. In Santiago city, the fruits of glossy privet are mainly consumed by the austral thrush (Turdus falcklandii Quoy & Gaimard), which could act as dispersers of their seeds. For this reason, we analyzed the role of endozoochory by the austral thrushes on the germination of glossy privet. We collected seeds from trees and feces of austral thrushes, and then we compared their viabilities and germination percentages. Viability was established using the tetrazolium test, while germination was studied using a factorial experiment (10 seeds in Petri dishes, replicated nine times for both sources). Our results showed that the germination of seeds from feces (58.3 %) was 12 % lower than those from trees (77.7 %), indicating that austral thrushes reduces significantly the germination percentage of the glossy privet. The viabilities of seeds from fruits and feces were 100 %. Because these values may be high enough to allow the population establishment, we suggest that further studies are necessary to examine the role of the endozoochory in the (unsuccessful) spread of the glossy privet in Chile. © 2016, Botanical Society of Sao Paulo.},

	abstract = {Amphibian chytridiomycosis, due to infection with the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), has been associated with the alarming decline and extinction crisis of amphibians worldwide. It is essential for conservation management to identify regions with high or low suitability for Bd. We use a species distribution model to estimate the environmental suitability of Bd in the Chilean Winter Rainfall–Valdivian Forest biodiversity hotspot. Fourteen environmental variables were used as predictors in the statistical modeling (Maxent, generalized linear models, random forest) which also included 56 independent Bd+ localities. High-risk areas (i.e., suitability above a defined threshold) were validated through prospective field surveys conducted in 2017. As results from Maxent, which only uses presence data, were the only results retained, refugia (i.e., suitability below a defined threshold) were validated with the Bd absences (N = 12) used in the GLM and RF modeling. Our results showed that (1) suitability for Bd increased with human footprint and with shorter distances to urban centers and water bodies and decreased with elevation; (2) climate was not a major factor shaping the current distribution of Bd; and (3) the model predicted high-risk and refugia areas fairly well. Surveys of 24 new localities in high-risk areas confirmed that 23 were Bd+; hence, these areas warrant consideration for long-term Bd surveillance, population monitoring, and disease mitigation. In addition, five localities with apparent Bd absence were found in the predicted high-risk areas. Our models showed that refugia can exist near high-risk areas and Bd+ sites. Four localities with apparent Bd absence were located within the refugia predicted by the model. Preventing Bd transmission to such refugia is of paramount importance for persistence of Bd-susceptible amphibian populations. The identification and validation through prospective field surveys of high-risk areas and refugia are imperative to develop strategies to prevent further arrival and establishment of Bd and also, by identifying amphibian species or populations of conservation concern in such areas, will help to guide specific actions to reduce the biodiversity loss caused by chytridiomycosis. © 2019 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Biocultural keystone species have been suggested for different societies, but there has been little empirical evaluation of their role in the face of rapid socio-environmental changes. The Aymara people of northern Chile have experienced historical and contemporary processes that have modified their culture and relationship with nature. The Andean Condor (Vultur gryphus) has previously been proposed as a biocultural keystone species for traditional Andean societies. We evaluate the validity of this assertion in the light of the traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) of today’s Aymara from the high Andes of northern Chile. A three-month ethnographic study was conducted in the Putre municipal district, including semistructured interviews, focus groups, and surveys of the district’s Aymara inhabitants. Our results indicate a nonarticulated set of information that can be identified as knowledge about the Andean Condor but is patchy and resembles relics, rather than an ongoing body of TEK that includes daily practices, social institutions, and a worldview shaped by the putative biocultural keystone species. Chileanization, migration, and the integration of evangelical religions into the area’s Catholic-Andean setting were identified as three processes that have deeply affected the transmission of TEK and the Aymara-condor relationship, with new generations living in socio-environmental contexts different from those of their ancestors. We suggest that, today, the condor can hardly be considered a biocultural keystone species for the Aymara people of northern Chile. Our study highlights that the role of putative biocultural keystone species is dependent on the vagaries of historical and contemporary socio-environmental processes occurring in the Andes and elsewhere. © 2019 by the author(s).},

	abstract = {Taxonomic and genetic diversity are among the components of biodiversity. Both components need to be taken in consideration to establish management and conservation strategies in high-priority areas for conservation. Pedro del Rio Zañartu park in the peninsula of Hualpen, contains one of the last relicts of the coastal forest of the Bio-Bio Region, mainly concentrated in the Terrestrial Biological Station (EBT) assigned to the University of Concepcion near to the city of Concepcion. In this study, we evaluated both taxonomic and genetic diversity of the peninsula to establish conservation strategies and future management plans in the area. We quantified the number of species along 20 transects within the park and in the surrounding areas. In addition, we measured the genetic diversity in five phylogenetically unrelated species, using AFLP markers. A total of 90 species were recorded, 78% native and 22% non-native. The highest species richness was found in the EBT area, having significance difference with the rest of the sampling sites. The genetic analysis showed similar values of genetic diversity than previously reported for species with similar biological traits and for the same studied species, in different zones of their distribution. Therefore, high levels of species richness and genetic diversity were found in the EBT. This could be as a result of the management and protection by the university. Considering the presence of endangered species within the EBT and the spatial distribution of species richness in the area, we recommend that the park Pedro del Rio Zañartu and surrounding areas need to be part of the areas protected by the government. © 2017, Universidad de Concepcion.

	abstract = {Species of Alnus (alders) have become invaders in several parts of the world. Here we report the presence of three naturalized alien species: A. glutinosa, A. incana and A. rubra from several populations in nature reserves of northwestern Patagonia, an area of remarkably high biodiversity. Alnus glutinosa had been cited previously for Chile and southern Argentina, but A. incana and A. rubra are here reported for the first time. As we found morphological variation within and among the populations of these introduced species that makes their discrimination difficult, we used chloroplast (trnH-psbA) and nuclear ribosomal (ITS) DNA sequences to confirm their identifications from morphological characteristics. Results from nuclear and chloroplast sequence data confirm the morphological tentative identification of the three species and remark the utility of molecular information together with morphology for the detection of introduced species of taxonomically difficult groups. The invasive characteristics of these alien tree species are discussed in relation to the conservation of the nature reserves where they are found. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Pseudonereis gallapagensis Kinberg, 1865 and P. variegata (Grube & Kröyer in Grube, 1858) are the only two species of this genus commonly recorded along Atlantic American coasts, but their type localities are in the Eastern Pacific, and their morphology differs. Two new Pseudonereis species are described from Eastern Mexico: P. brunnea sp. n. from the Gulf of Mexico, and P. citrina sp. n. from the Caribbean Sea, previously confused with P. gallapagensis. In order to facilitate comparisons, descriptions based on specimens from near the type locality for P. gallapagensis (Peru and Ecuador), and topotypes for P. variegata (Valparaiso, Chile), are included. Based on these comparisons and current descriptions, the syn-onymies of Nereis ferox Hansen, 1882 described from Brazil with P. variegata, and of Pseudonereis formosa Kinberg, 1865 described from Hawaii with P. gallapagensis, are rejected. Consequently, both are regarded as distinct species and revised diagnoses are provided for them. The record of P. ferox from the Gulf of Guinea proved to be an undescribed species, and is herein described as P. fauveli sp. n. The number of paragnath rows in nereidid pharynx areas VII–VIII has been interpreted in several ways, leading to confusion; an alternative method to determine the number of bands and rows is proposed. The midventral region, the division of areas VII–VIII in furrow and ridge regions, and the description of the arrangement based on the pattern of paragnaths in such regions, are proposed. Further, the terms shield-shaped and pointed (P-bars) bars are redefined, and a new term, crescent-shaped bars, is proposed for paragnaths in the areas VI in some Pseudonereis and Perinereis species. A key for all Pseudonereis species is also included. Copyright © 2018 Magnolia Press.},

	abstract = {Xenarthrans—anteaters, sloths, and armadillos—have essential functions for ecosystem maintenance, such as insect control and nutrient cycling, playing key roles as ecosystem engineers. Because of habitat loss and fragmentation, hunting pressure, and conflicts with domestic dogs, these species have been threatened locally, regionally, or even across their full distribution ranges. The Neotropics harbor 21 species of armadillos, 10 anteaters, and 6 sloths. Our data set includes the families Chlamyphoridae (13), Dasypodidae (7), Myrmecophagidae (3), Bradypodidae (4), and Megalonychidae (2). We have no occurrence data on Dasypus pilosus (Dasypodidae). Regarding Cyclopedidae, until recently, only one species was recognized, but new genetic studies have revealed that the group is represented by seven species. In this data paper, we compiled a total of 42,528 records of 31 species, represented by occurrence and quantitative data, totaling 24,847 unique georeferenced records. The geographic range is from the southern United States, Mexico, and Caribbean countries at the northern portion of the Neotropics, to the austral distribution in Argentina, Paraguay, Chile, and Uruguay. Regarding anteaters, Myrmecophaga tridactyla has the most records (n = 5,941), and Cyclopes sp. have the fewest (n = 240). The armadillo species with the most data is Dasypus novemcinctus (n = 11,588), and the fewest data are recorded for Calyptophractus retusus (n = 33). With regard to sloth species, Bradypus variegatus has the most records (n = 962), and Bradypus pygmaeus has the fewest (n = 12). Our main objective with Neotropical Xenarthrans is to make occurrence and quantitative data available to facilitate more ecological research, particularly if we integrate the xenarthran data with other data sets of Neotropical Series that will become available very soon (i.e., Neotropical Carnivores, Neotropical Invasive Mammals, and Neotropical Hunters and Dogs). Therefore, studies on trophic cascades, hunting pressure, habitat loss, fragmentation effects, species invasion, and climate change effects will be possible with the Neotropical Xenarthrans data set. Please cite this data paper when using its data in publications. We also request that researchers and teachers inform us of how they are using these data. © 2019 The Authors.

	abstract = {Background. Habanero pepper (Capsicum chinense Jacq.) is a vegetable of economic interest, its fruits have unique characteristics of flavor and pungency. Its pungency is due to the capsaicinoids, which were the starting research interest on this crop. In tins review, the historical scientific information about habanero pepper in Mexico was analyzed. in order to have an overview of the past, present and the perspectives for research. Objective. To analyze the scientific research of habanero pepper in different regions of Mexico and identify its importance as a model plant study. Methodology. Fifteen databases and several key words were used to found the scientific research articles. Using their titles and aims, articles were grouped in eight research topic: 1) Biochemistry, 2) Genetics-Biotechnology, 3) Microbiology-Pests-Diseases, 4) Nutrition, 5) Physiology-Phenology. 6) Agronomic productivity, 7) Plant genetic resources and 8) Food and medical uses. The publications were sorted by year and region, the status of the journals and impact factor were analyzed. Main findings. In total 127 articles were analyzed and 69.3% of these were carried out at Yucatan Peninsula. 67% were published in journals indexed in the Journal of Citation Reports (JCR). Along years, publications of habanero peppers increased in other regions of Mexico; in addition, the research topics diversified. The first research article about habanero pepper in Mexico was published in 1998. In the area of biochemistry there were more publications (29), of which 24 were indexed in JCR. Implications. Most of the research of habanero pepper in Mexico can be classified as basic science, few manuscripts were about applied research. Conclusions. The capsaicinoids studies were the topic detonating research interest in this species as a model plant study, over time, the themes on this crop were diversified and the number of articles on habanero pepper has strengthened. However, more emphasis should be placed on studies focusing in solving the main problems of producers. © 2020 Universidad Autonoma de Yucatan. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Native Useful Plants of Chile: A Review and Use Patterns. We compiled an inventory of the uses of the native flora of Chile by extracting uses cited in the literature until 2015. The inventory reported use citations for a total of 995 species of useful vascular plants (23% of Chile’s flora). These data were used to test the hypothesis that some plant families are overrepresented (overused) for some use categories. We used two statistical approaches: a Bayesian and an imprecise Dirichlet model (IDM). Families with a higher number of useful species are Asteraceae, Poaceae, Fabaceae, and Solanaceae. However, according to both the Bayesian and IDM approaches, the Grossulariaceae, Myrtaceae, Lamiaceae, Nothofagaceae, Salicaceae, Rosaceae, and Bromeliaceae are overrepresented. We found 501 species with medicinal uses, 228 with edible uses, 341 used for animal fodder, 300 considered ornamental, 102 used as dyes, 89 for ritual purposes, 75 for timber, and 51 species as a source of fiber. Over 43% of the useful species are endemic to Chile, and 4.7% are threatened. Our results indicate that the plant families of Chile with greater species richness are more likely to have a higher number of useful plants. However, some families tend to be overrepresented and others underrepresented within the different use categories, suggesting a non-random taxonomic distribution pattern of flora use. © 2019, The New York Botanical Garden.},

	abstract = {A national-scale study of outcrossing potential within Chilean vascular flora was conducted using an upgraded algorithm, which adds parameters such as pollinator agents, climate, and geographic conditions. Datasets were organized and linked in a Web platform (www.flujogenico.cl), in which the development of a total outcrossing potential (TOP) predictor was formulated. The TOP predictor is the engine in the Web platform, which models the effect of a type of agricultural practice on others (coexistence calculation mode) and on the environment (biodiversity calculation mode). The scale for TOP results uses quintiles in order to define outcrossing potential between species as “very low,” “low,” “medium,” “high,” or “very high.” In a coexistence analysis considering 256 species (207 genera), the 10 highest TOP values were for genera Citrus, Prunus, Trifolium, Brassica, Allium, Eucalyptus, Cucurbita, Solanum, Lollium, and Lotus. The highest TOP for species in this analysis fell at “high” potential, 4.9% of the determined values. In biodiversity mode, seven out of 256 cultivated species (2.7%) were native, and 249 (97.3%) corresponded to introduced species. The highest TOP was obtained in the genera Senecio, Calceolaria, Viola, Solanum, Poa, Alstroemeria, Valeriana, Vicia, Atriplex, and Campanula, showing “high” potential in 4.9% of the values. On the other hand, 137 genetically modified species, including the commercial and pre-commercial developments, were included and represented 100 genera. Among these, 22 genera had relatives (i.e., members of the same genus) in the native/introduced group. The genera with the highest number of native/introduced relatives ranged from one (Ipomea, Limonium, Carica, Potentilla, Lotus, Castanea, and Daucus) to 66 species (Solanum). The highest TOP was obtained when the same species were coincident in both groups, such as for Carica chilensis, Prosopis tamarugo, and Solanum tuberosum. Results are discussed from the perspective of assessing the possible impact of cultivated species on Chilean flora biodiversity. The TOP predictor (http://epc.agroinformatica.cl/) is useful in the context of environmental risk assessment. © 2017 The Authors. Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {Growth of the urban population in central Chile may have contributed to increased CO2 emissions, thus information regarding the role of turfgrass in public spaces and its ability to sequester CO2 would be valuable. The objectives of this study were to assess and compare the magnitude of C sequestration of seven newly established turfgrass species to bare soil using seasonal organic C stocks measurements aboveground (aboveground organic carbon [AOC]) and belowground (soil organic carbon [SOC]) and to associate these data with turfgrass seasonal photosynthetic behavior. Festuca arundinacea Schreb, Festuca rubra L. ssp. rubra, Cynodon dactylon L., Cynodon dactylon L. × Cynodon trans-vaalensis Burtt Davy, Poa pratensis L., P. trivialis L., and Lolium perenne L., and areas with bare soil were established during 2010. Soil samples from 10, 20, and 30 cm were collected over 2 yr. Cuttings from each turfgrass species were also collected seasonally after reaching higher than the 4 cm cutting height. The SOC and AOC were assessed using the Modified Mebius method. The CO2 assimilation rate, stomatal conductance and photosynthetic water use efficiency were measured seasonally over 2 yr using an infrared gas analyzer. Turfgrass species with high photosynthetic activity during the summer, such as C. dactylon and F. arundinacea ‘Bingo’, resulted in a high total SOC of 2.4 t SOC ha–1 and 2.7 t SOC ha–1, respectively, when compared with bare soil (0.9 t SOC ha–1) at the end of the study. © 2017 by the American Society of Agronomy},

	abstract = {The rate of establishment of non-native bark beetle species is accelerating in many parts of the world and is considered a serious threat to forests and forest crops. Distributional data for exotic bark beetles are urgently needed, but they must be based on sound taxonomy. Using primary literature and original records, I review for the first time the invasive bark beetle (Scolytinae) species in Chile and Argentina, and I give a short risk assessment for each. I also provide the best sources for identifying these species. The invasive pine bark beetle commonly referred to in Chilean research as Orthotomicus erosus (Wollaston) is not that species: evidence suggests that the only Orthotomicus that is or has been in Chile is O. laricis (Fabricius), which is also the Orthotomicus species reported in the most recent research from Argentina. I add new information on the distributions of two other abundant pine-breeding invasive species, Hylurgus ligniperda (F.) and Hylastes ater (Paykull), and I report that populations of Hylastes linearis Erichson have been found in Chile. This is the first known occurrence of the species in South America. Phloeotribus willei Schedl, a tiny bark beetle collected from domestic fig trees in Chile and Peru, has been considered native heretofore. I argue that it must be an introduced Neotropical species, and I present new localities for Chile. I present the first Chilean records of the Myrtaceae specialist ambrosia beetle Amasa truncata (Erichson), an Australian species recently found in southern Brazil and northeastern Uruguay, and new Argentinian records that seem to be the earliest finds of Xylosandrus crassiusculus (Motschulsky) in South America. The Canary Island palm seed specialist Dactylotrypes longicollis (Wollaston) is reported for the first time from South America, from Chile. The presence in Chile of another spermatophage, Coccotrypes dactyliperda (F.), is confirmed. New Chilean regions and new host records are given for Pagiocerus frontalis (F.), a species that breeds in Lauraceae seeds but also in stored maize. Other exotic species treated briefly include Hylastinus obscurus (Marsham), Hylesinus taranio (Danthione), Scolytus multistriatus (Marsham), S. rugulosus (Müller), Coccotrypes cyperi (Beeson), and Xyleborinus saxeseni (Ratzeburg). Finally, reports of several species from Chile or Argentina are considered unsupported by evidence: Scolytus kirschii Skalitzky, Pityokteines curvidens (Germar), Coccotrypes robustus Eichhoff, and Hypothenemus hampei (Ferrari). La velocidad de establecimiento de especies de coleópteros descortezadores no nativos se está acelerando en muchas partes del mundo y se considera una amenaza seria a bosques y cultivos forestales. Se requiere datos distribucionales urgentemente, pero estos tienen que basarse en taxonomía sólida. Utilizando literatura primaria y registros originales, reviso por primera vez la fauna invasora de especies de descortezadores (Scolytinae) en Chile y Argentina, y ofrezco una evaluación breve del riesgo de cada una. También proporciono los mejores referencias para identificar estas especies. La especie descortezador invasora de pinos comunmente citado en investigaciones chilenas como Orthotomicus erosus (Wollaston) no es esa: la evidencia sugiere que la única especie de Orthotomicus actualmente o históricamente presente en Chile es O. laricis (Fabricius), la cual es la especie de Orthotomicus reportado en las investigaciones mas recientes de Argentina. Agrego información nueva sobre las distribuciones de otros dos especies abundantes invasoras que se reproducen en pinos, Hylurgus ligniperda (F.) y Hylastes ater (Paykull) y comunico que poblaciones de Hylastes linearis Erichson se han encontrado en Chile, siendo esta el primer hallazgo de la especie en Sudamérica. Phloeotribus willei Schedl, una especie minúscula colectado de higueras cultivadas en Chile y Peru, se ha considerado nativa hasta ahora: presento argumentos que debe de ser una especie neotropical introducida y presento nuevas localidades para Chile. Presento los primeros registros chilenos de Amasa truncata (Erichson) coleóptero ambrosial, especialista en Myrtaceae, especie australiana recientemente encontrada en el sur de Brasil y nordeste de Uruguay, y nuevos registros argentinos que parecen ser los primeros hallazgos de Xylosandrus crassiusculus (Motschulsky) en Sudamérica. Se registra la especialista en semillas de palma, Dactylotrypes longicollis (Wollaston), originario de las Islas Canárias pro primera vez de Sudamérica; se confirma la presencia en Chile de otra espermatófago, Coccotrypes dactyliperda (F.). Se presentan nuevos registros regionales de Chile y de hospederas por Pagiocerus frontalis (F.), especie que se reproduce en semillas de Lauraceae pero también en maíz almacenado. Otras especies exóticas tratadas brevemente incluyen Hylastinus obscurus (Marsham), Hylesinus taranio (Danthione), Scolytus multistriatus (Marsham), S. rugulosus (Müller), Coccotrypes cyperi (Beeson), y Xyleborinus saxeseni (Ratzeburg).

	abstract = {Background: Urbanisation is a dominant geographical trend and an important component of global change, with unprecedented implications for socio-economic, cultural and environmental characteristics. However, green areas, including original fragments, can help to conserve native diversity, improving the functioning of these artificial systems in the long term. Urban areas can still provide habitats usable by wild birds, however the structural characteristics of the habitat formed by different types of green area differ, and therefore dissimilar bird diversities are to be expected. The object of this study was to characterise the α and β diversities of birds in different green areas and to analyse how diversity relates to ten variables that characterise the habitat. Methods: We studied the green areas in the city of Temuco, southern Chile (Park, Square and Median strips of main streets), evaluating the variables: (a) surface area, (b) vegetation, (c) estimated human impact as the proportions of vegetation and bare soil by area, and the vehicle traffic. The bird assemblage structures were characterised by α (intra-environment) diversity and β diversity (between environments) and the statistical analysis identified the environmental variables related with the presence and abundance of birds. A statistical model was constructed to describe the contribution of the variables to bird diversity. Results: We found significant differences between the diversity of bird species in the three types of green area. The β showed medium to high similarity between the different study units. There was a negative correlation with bare soil areas; the correlations with vehicle flow, plant structure and tree and shrub cover were not significant, meaning that these variables did not explain the variation in the richness of bird species between the green areas. However the surface area did explain this variation presenting a positive potential relation. There was also a high correlation with the origin (native) of shrub species. Conclusions: The bird diversity varied significantly according to the type of urban green area. The environmental variables presenting significant correlations with bird diversity were: surface area, native species of shrub stratum, shrub cover, and bare soil area. The best multiple regression model showed that the three most important variables for bird diversity are the surface area of the green area, the cover of the shrub stratum and the presence of native shrub species. © 2018 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {It is traditionally accepted that urban vegetation contributes to improve air quality by intercepting and retaining the particulate matter. Although the mitigating role of plants has been recognized by several studies, the role of individual species is still poorly understood. This is particularly important in cities like Santiago (Chile), which has high levels of atmospheric particulate and also has high plant species diversity. In this study, we evaluated the retention of atmospheric particles by three widely distributed ornamental species (Nerium oleander, Pittosporum tobira, and Ligustrum lucidum) in Santiago. For this proposal, we took leaf samples in different sampling points across the city which vary in their concentration of atmospheric particulate. Samples were taken 12 and 16 days after a rainfall episode that washed the leaves of plants in the sampling sites. In the laboratory, leaves were washed to recover the surface retained particles that were collected to determine its mass gravimetrically. With this information, we estimated the foliar retention (mass of particulate matter retained in the foliar surface) and daily retention efficiency (mass of particulate matter retained in the foliar surface per day). We found that foliar retention and daily retention efficiency varied significantly between the studied species. The leaves of N. oleander retained 8.2 g m−2 of particulate matter on average, those of P. tobira 6.1 g m−2, and those of L. lucidum 3.9 g m−2; meanwhile, the daily retention efficiencies of particulate matter were 0.6, 0.4, and 0.3 g m−2 day−1 for N. oleander, P. tobira, and L. lucidum, respectively. These results suggest that the studied species retain atmospheric particulate matter differentially in Santiago. These results can be attributed to differences on leaf surface characteristics. The recognition of the most efficient species in the retention of the atmospheric particulate matter can help to decide which species can be used to improve the air quality in the city. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Urbanization is expanding continuously over rural and natural areas and it is imperative to analyze its effect on bird communities. Although the impact of urbanization on bird communities in the Neotropical region has been explored by several authors, there is a scarcity of comparative studies with standardized methodologies that allow establishing whether the effects of urbanization are similar in different ecoregions. We analyzed the urbanization impact on bird communities in three Neotropical cities. Cities were located in different biomes: La Paz (Bolivia) surrounded by a highland plateau and inter-Andean valleys; Mar del Plata (Argentina) surrounded by agroecosystems of the pampas; and Osorno (Chile), surrounded by agroecosystems, timber plantations, and remnants of temperate forests. In general, high levels of urbanization correlated negatively with bird richness in the three cities, but the response of bird richness to urbanization varied among cities, being linearly negative in La Paz and Osorno and declining only towards high levels of urbanization in Mar del Plata. The effect of urbanization was stronger in La Paz, where more bird species were absent toward higher urbanization levels. Bird abundance did not show significant responses to urbanization. Exotic bird abundance showed a positive relationship with urbanization in the three cities. Bird composition differed between cities and urbanization levels. The House Sparrow (Passer domesticus) was the most abundant species in more urbanized sites, the Eared Dove (Zenaida auriculata) in moderate levels of urbanization, whereas the Rufous-collared Sparrow (Zonotrichia capensis) was most abundant in the less urbanized sites. The results of our study showed that the impact of urbanization on bird communities in the Neotropical region varied among cities, probably as a result of latitude and the structure of rural areas. © The Neotropical Ornithological Society.},

	abstract = {Castanea sativa Mill. is a specie of agroforestry interest widely grown in Europe, its current production it is mainly focused on the extraction of a quality brown fruit, highly demanded in the gourmet industry. In Chile, this specie might be successfully grown due to the climate and lack of diseases that may affect it. However, there is not a propagation system that can provide a plant massification for the establishment of fruit orchards. Given this situation, the micropropagation is a possible alternative to apply since this method is extensively studied in this species. The propagation in vitro of Castanea sativa has created successful results in terms of introduction and multiplication. Nevertheless, the propagation in vitro of direct-producer varieties of brown fruit is still poorly studied and for this situation, in order to stablish a production system of a variety of plants of great interest is necessary to evaluate the effects of some variables that affects the in vitro culture of woody as it is the genotype and cytokine source. For this, six varieties of chestnut from Italy and France and two types of cytokines were studied to evaluate their effects on the parameters in vitro establishment as survival, contamination, formation of basal callus, axillary bud break, etc. The results indicate that in the same culture conditions the varieties with better response is Marrone Citta di Castello (CC) and Marrone Chiusa di Pesio (CP), in relation to the formation of basal callus and morphological reaction capacity, where the percentage of explants was greater than 80% and 85%, respectively, independent of the type of cytokinin used. Moreover, the amount of explants with axillary bud break was higher in the treatment with 0.5 mg L-1 of 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) with 100% in CC and 55% in CP, being there significant differences with the obtained response in the treatment with 0.5 mg L-1 of Thidiazuron (TDZ), where 10% and 15% of explants with axillary bud break were observed, respectively. These results indicate that the genotype and cytokine source have influence on the response of in vitro establishment of nodal segments of chestnut variety, therefore, to establish a propagation system it is necessary to adjust a specific protocol for each variety. © 2017, Universidad de Concepcion.

	abstract = {Background Scrub typhus is a potentially life-threatening vector-borne infection caused by Orientia species. It occurs mainly in the Asian-Pacific region, where it causes significant morbidity and mortality. Recently, an endemic focus of scrub typhus has been described in South America, on Chiloé Island in southern Chile. Dogs have been used as sentinel hosts to determine the presence and spatial distribution of various vector-borne infections. Their suitability to gain insight into human exposure to Orientia tsutsugamushi has been suggested in studies from Asia. Methodology In January 2016, we conducted a cross-sectional study, which included the two main cities on Chiloé Island. Canine blood samples were obtained in households, chosen by double stratified random sampling in urban and by convenience in rural locations. Specimens were tested by ELISA for IgG antibodies against whole-cell antigen preparations from three strains of O. tsutsugamushi. Data were further analyzed for factors associated with seropositivity including spatial clustering. Results Serum samples from 202 dogs (104 urban, 98 rural) were tested for IgG against O. tsutsugamushi, of which 43 (21.3%) were positive. Seroprevalence rates were higher in rural than in urban settings (p<0.01) and in older compared to younger dogs (p<0.01). Spatial analysis by LISA indicated the presence of four localities of highly grouped cases. Conclusions The detected seroprevalence supports the endemicity of scrub typhus in southern Chile and suggests a wide exposure of household dogs to the infected, yet unknown vector(s). The spatial data will be used for future research identifying further human cases as well as the local vector(s)/reservoirs for scrub typhus in southern Chile. The study reinforces that dogs are useful sentinels for Orientia spp. in regions of uncertain endemicity and distribution.

	abstract = {Clonal rootstocks are one alternative used by the walnut industry to control damage caused by Phytophthora species, traditionally using plants grafted on susceptible Juglans regia rootstock. Vlach, VX211, and RX1 are clonal rootstocks with a degree of resistance to Phytophthora species. The resistance to pathogens in these rootstocks depends on the resistance mechanisms activated by the presence of the pathogen and subsequent development of responses in the host. In this work, we analyzed how plants of J. regia, Vlach, VX211, and RX1 responded to inoculation with Phytophthora cinnamomi or Phytophthora citrophthora isolates obtained from diseased English walnut plants from Chilean orchards. After inoculation, plants of Vlach, VX211, and RX1 showed canopy and root damage indexes that did not differ from noninoculated control plants. In contrast, plants of J. regia, which is susceptible to P. cinnamomi and P. citrophthora, died after inoculation. Vlach, VX211, and RX1 plants inoculated with P. cinnamomi or P. citrophthora showed greater root weight and volume and greater root growth rates than their respective controls. These results suggest that short-term carbohydrate dynamics may be related to the defense mechanisms of plants; they are immediately activated after inoculation through the production of phenolic compounds, which support the further growth and development of roots in walnut clonal rootstocks. To our knowledge, this is the first study that comprehensively characterizes vegetative and radicular growth and the dynamics of sugars and phenols in response to infection with P. cinnamomi or P. citrophthora in walnut rootstocks. © 2020 The American Phytopathological Society},

	abstract = {Introduction – Several native tree species are scarcely studied in relation to fruit properties. In order to bring about information of these plant resources, the characterization of ripening-associated properties of the fruit of three endemic and threatened Chilean trees (Citronella mucronata, Pitavia punctata and Beilschmiedia berteroana) was performed in the present study. Materials and methods – The physiochemical characterization of two developmental fruit stages in each species included the measurement of soluble solid content (SSC), titratable acidity (TA), pH, color and chlorophyll content; cell wall composition and lignin content; the total phenolic content and antioxidant capacity of the fruit extracts. Moreover, the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was carried out in fruit extracts against 11 bacterial strains. Results and discussion – Pitavia punctata and B. berteroana fruits exhibited similar SSC and TA values showing a significant increase of the SSC:TA ratio during development. However, C. mucronata showed the highest SSC value at stage II with 8.1 °Brix, accompanied by a noticeable color change. The analysis of pectin fractions suggests that solubilisation of pectic polymers increase during fruit development in all species. The fruits of C. mucronata presented the highest level of total uronic acids (for stage I and II, a 63% and 71% of the cell wall material, respectively). The phenolic content, antioxidant capacity and MIC were particularly remarkable in P. punctata fruits at stage II, when fruit reaches 6.5 °Brix, with values of 924.4 mg GAE 100 g-1 FW, 2.51 mM FeSO4 g-1 FW, and 6.25% v/v, respectively. Conclusion – These results relate interesting properties of C. mucronata and P. punctata fruits for food and pharmaceutical industries with physiological indexes at stage II, mainly soluble solids and color. © ISHS 2017.},

	abstract = {In terrestrial plants, it is well known that genetic diversity can affect responses to abiotic and biotic stress and have important consequences on farming. However, very little is known about the interactive effects of genetic and environmental factors on seaweed crops. We conducted a field experiment on Gracilaria chilensis to determine the effect of heterozygosity and nutrient addition on two southern Chilean farms: Ancud and Chaica. In addition to growth rate and productivity, we measured photosynthetic responses, photosynthetic pigment concentration (chlorophyll a and phycobiliproteins), C:N ratio (C:N), and epiphytic load. Nutrient addition affected the growth rate, productivity, phycobilin, and C:N content, but not the epiphytic load. These results were independent of the heterozygosity of the strains used in the experiments. Interestingly, depending on the sampled sites, distinct photosynthetic responses (i.e., maximal quantum yield, Fv/Fm, and maximal electron transport rate, ETRmax) to nutrient addition were observed. We propose that thallus selection over the past few decades may have led to ecological differentiation between G. chilensis from Chaica and Ancud. The lack of effect of heterozygosity on growth and physiological responses could be related to the species domestication history in which there is a limited range of genetic variation in farms. We suggest that the existing levels of heterozygosity among our thalli is not sufficient to detect any significant effect of genetic diversity on growth or productivity in Metri bay, our experimental site located close to the city of Puerto Montt, during summer under nitrogen limiting conditions. © 2018 Phycological Society of America},

	abstract = {Over the last few decades, the Chilean Government has constantly promoted the construction of private highways in order to increase the effectiveness in terms of transportation of goods and people all along the country. In this way, heavy road infrastructures, landscape fragmentation, loss of endangered animals' habitat, loss of visual quality, and a decrease of biodiversity patches have emerged. Despite this, some greenery - native and introduced flora/fauna, natural elements, colors, lines, patterns, among others- can be partly seen in certain areas of Chilean highways. In particular, this paper focuses on the main route connecting Puerto Montt and Pargua cities in Los Lagos region. The objectives of this qualitative research are threefold. Firstly, to measure main Landscape attributes and Visual scale characteristics through a fieldwork by the roadside of Pargua highway (Alto Bonito Area) using a scale of attributes adapted from Tveit et al. (2007). Secondly, to measure the type of vegetation through an environmental inventory (phytosociological analysis). Thirdly, to measure the degree of management of the highway considering its maintenance and human intervention. Wilderness and Naturalness are scarcely observed on the roadside due to a concentrated presence of human interventions such as landfills and overpasses. The visual scale is checked in fieldwork from several scopes. On the southeast side of the road, Las Canchas Area is covered by high trees, houses, and industries which hinder the view of the natural surrounding landscape. On the right side of the road, it presents a clear skyline of Calbuco and Osorno volcanoes. Finally, any management of high quality of the visual scenery of this type of landscape from the route concessionaire is is randomly done. However, the vegetation surface itself has been working out a way to protect the land from erosion and desertification. © The Authors. 2018.},

	abstract = {Hornby's Storm Petrel Oceanodroma hornbyi is endemic to the Humboldt Current Region. Historically, little has been known about the location of the species' breeding sites or the size of its population. For these reasons, this species has been classified as 'Data Deficient' by IUCN, and it is difficult to know whether the species is threatened, and if so, what conservation actions may be necessary. As part of the project 'Golondrinas del Desierto' a search for the colonies of this species began in November 2013. It was known that the species breeds in the Atacama Desert, because some mummified individuals had been found there, and fledglings attracted by lights whilst on their way to the sea were found in nearby coastal cities. In this paper, we describe the first breeding site discovered for this species. This breeding location is 75 km from the shoreline, at 1100 meters above sea level, in the centre of the Atacama Desert, also known as the 'absolute desert'. However, there is strong anthropogenic pressure on this desert due to the development of mines and solar energy projects. To protect these birds, it is important to estimate the breeding population size of the colony, search for new colonies and assess the threats to each of them, and to evaluate how many fledglings are drawn off course by lights into cities and industrial sites and how many die there. © 2019 Nederlandse Ornithologische Unie.

	abstract = {Monitoring long-term trends in population size is important for species’ conservation assessments. However, it may be unfeasible for rare species, for which past records are typically sparse. Here, I investigate the potential of birding trip reports as an underappreciated source of biological information to monitor rare species. For this purpose, I used an uncommon species – the Peruvian thick-knee Burhinus superciliaris – as an example to assess population trends over 2000–2010, using flock size dynamics as a proxy. I collected all observations of thick-knees that could be accessed from birding trip reports across the entire geographic range of the species. In total, I compiled 218 records of 2403 individuals, of which 73.9% were fully useable for this study. Mean flock size declined slightly over the study period in Central Peru, whereas in North Chile it increased at the beginning of the decade and then decreased nearly 90% until the end of the study period. This suggests that, at least at the southernmost part of the distribution range of the thick-knee, the magnitude and speed of the change in population size could be sufficient to qualify for a threatened category. The use of birding trip reports as a data source for monitoring trends of rare species seems promising compared to other sources, since sightings of sought-after species are increasingly posted online as a form of tourist attraction and so made publicly accessible for researchers and managers. This study highlights the great utility that birding trip reports freely available online may have to provide retrospective data on rare species that would otherwise be impossible to collect. Nonetheless, they might not be universally valid due to species-specific differences and possible lack of non-detection records. Potential biases due to varying sampling effort or detectability should also be carefully considered. © 2016 The Zoological Society of London},

	abstract = {Green roofs have been built and studied mainly in humid climates and provide many benefits, from thermal insulation to biodiversity. However, little is known about their performance in arid and semiarid regions where irrigation requirements can affect their sustainability. In order to examine and evaluate the performance of green roofs in a semiarid climate, 114-m2 green roof modules were built and monitored for a year. The experimental setup consisted on nine different roof designs or modules, one of them with two additional replicates (11 modules in total). The study was performed in Santiago, Chile (33°26′S, 70°39′W, 570 MASL), a region with a typical semiarid climate. Three substrate depths (5-cm, 10-cm and 20-cm) and four commercial drainage systems were evaluated. The modules were implemented with a sprinkler irrigation system and instrumented to record air temperature, precipitation, and substrate water content and temperature at 5-min intervals. The results showed that substrate depth controls the amplitude in substrate temperature. The 10-cm and 20-cm depth modules showed a significant damping effect on substrate temperature. In addition, the 10-cm and 20-cm depth modules showed maximum daily temperatures up to 13 °C below the air temperature. In contrast, the 5-cm depth modules increased the amplitude in substrate temperature, reaching in average 13.8 °C more than the daily maximum air temperature in spring and 2.6 °C less than the daily minimum air temperature in summer. The 10-cm and 20-cm depth modules provided a stable and suitable substrate water content during the entire study period, while the 5-cm depth green roofs were more affected by the atmospheric demand. Although their limitations were partially overcome by increasing irrigation rates or adding a retention fabric to improve the substrate water holding capacity, the 5-cm depth green roofs experienced daily thermal amplitudes beyond the recommended value for plant development. Consequently, extensive (or thin) green roofs (less than 10 cm of growing medium) are unlikely to be recommended in arid or semiarid climates. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Background: Current knowledge of urban bird ecology and biodiversity relies on evidence from cities of the Northern Hemisphere, while the Southern Hemisphere is underrepresented. Santiago is a large city from South America, located in central Chile, which is both a biodiversity hotspot and an Endemic Bird Area. This work is a synthesis, which aims to provide a diversity account for Santiago, and to describe the broad geographic distribution and bird functional patterns. Methods: We synthesized a seven-year (2009-2016) bird register from the eBird database (21,865 georeferenced registers at Santiago) into a single avifaunal account, along with the observed number of individuals. We complemented these registers by using available literature about Santiago's avifauna (28 references). We investigated the proportion of native/ exotic, migrants/residents, conservation categories, and urban nesting status. We classified Santiago's birds into seven trophic guilds. We plotted species richness and number of individuals for each functional group, by interpolating trough the Inverse Distance Weighted Method. Results: We found that Santiago's avifauna (46 species) is composed mainly by native (41), resident (38), non-threatened species (46) that breed inside the city (31). Some functional groups inhabit a large portion of Santiago's urban surface, reaching high values of richness and abundance. Among these groups are the native, urban-nesters and resident species; even though exotics possess low species richness (5), they are abundant and inhabit the complete urban surface of the city. The dominant trophic guilds are omnivorous (11) and granivorous (10). Insectivorous are the third most abundant trophic guild, and show the highest species richness (13). Conclusion: The functional groups with lower species richness are less abundant and display reduced and patchy distributions in Santiago. This is probably because of the low availability of suitable habitats and/or restricted food supply (migrants, carnivorous, nectarivorous, frugivorous, herbivorous and piscivorous). The high insectivorous richness reported in Santiago, along with similar patterns reported in several cities in the Neotropics, provides evidence to postulate a pattern of high species richness of this guild in cities across this biogeographic realm. © The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli are the leading cause of food-related diarrhea worldwide. However, other campylobacteria such as other Campylobacter spp., Arcobacter spp. and Helicobacter spp. are also recognised as emerging pathogens, although they are not frequently isolated by traditional culturing methods. Moreover, Campylobacter spp. have become increasingly resistant to antibiotics due to antibiotic usage in animal and human medicine. It has been suggested that pet ownership increases the risk for campylobacteriosis. However, environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and poor sanitation conditions have also been associated with the highest rates of shedding among animals. This study assessed the faecal shedding of campylobacteria in an urban coastal area among 68 (66.0%) domestic animals, mainly dogs (n=61), and 35 (33.9%) wild animals belonging to 13 species and eight orders. None of them had symptoms of gastroenteritis and campylobacteria were detected by PCR in 21 samples (20.4%), while only six (5.8%) were detected by culturing, i.e. Campylobacter upsaliensis (n=4, dogs), C. jejuni (n=1, dog) and Arcobacter butzleri (n=1, chicken). None of the isolates was resistant to ciprofloxacin, but two were resistant to erythromycin, i.e. A. butzleri (MIC=8 µg/ml) and C. upsaliensis (MIC=128 µg/ml). Regarding the virulence factors, only one isolate of C. jejuni was positive for cdtC and cadF genes and one isolate of A. butzleri was positive for cadF and ciaB genes. This is the first study to assess the faecal shedding of campylobacteria in animals from the urban coastal area of Valparaíso, Chile. Although C. jejuni and other emerging campylobacteria were detected mainly from pet dogs and in a low rate, further investigations are needed to assess the potential transmission of these zoonotic bacteria or their antibiotic resistance between pets and owners. © 2019 Universidad Austral de Chile.

Currently, they are considered an invasive species in 19 countries and a pest—even in their native distribution—because of economic losses derived from their impacts. During the reproductive seasons of 2017 and 2018, we registered interactions between invasive monk parakeets and resident bird species in Santiago, Chile. We observed agonistic and affiliative interactions, and further, we described monk parakeets’ nest occupancy by nine bird species, two invasive and seven native. For this reason, we consider that the monk parakeet is an allogenic ecosystem engineer with the potential to shape distribution and richness of sympatric species in urban environments. Our results contribute to an assessment of the implications of the monk parakeet’s ecological invasion to other synanthropic species, and raise concern of other potential impacts, such as pathogen transmission derived from these interactions. © 2019 by the authors.

	abstract = {Anthropogenic soil contamination with heavy metals has received much attention in recent years, especially cadmium (Cd), which is a very toxic element for human health and is exposure is mainly through contaminated food. Maize (Zea mays L.) is one of the most important cereals in the human diet that is characterized as species whose cultivars differ in Cd accumulation. Therefore, identifying and selecting low Cd-accumulating genetic material will contribute to reducing its ingestion. Among the agricultural crops that are important for Cd in the human diet is maize. Cadmium contents in three maize cultivars were grown under different environments conditions in Chile where soils were enriched with increasing Cd rates, were evaluated. Grain yield, Cd concentration in different plant tissues, and soil post-harvest, were evaluated. Results showed that grain yield was not affected by soil Cd; however, plant tissues generally exhibited differences in Cd concentration associated with the environment, La Serena showed the highest grain Cd accumulation (30 µg kg-1; P < 0.05). In addition, among cultivars, Pioneer showed the highest grain Cd concentration (19.5 µg kg-1; P < 0.05). Grain Cd concentration of the three maize cultivars were within the range cited in the bibliography as not toxic. © 2017, Sociedad Chilena de la Ciencia del Suelo. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Mercury (Hg) is a complex and multifaceted global pollutant. Artisanal and small-scale gold mining activities are largely responsible for Hg contamination in developing countries, in many cases impacting areas of high biodiversity such as the Amazon. The aim of the study was to establish Hg exposure in indigenous citizens from the Tarapaca village, Cotuhe and Putumayo Rivers, at the Colombian Amazon. Total Hg (T-Hg) concentrations were measured employing a DMA-80 Hg analyzer. For that purpose, 190 hair samples were taken from volunteers living in different communities of Tarapaca. The overall mean T-Hg level for all samples was 10.6 ± 0.4 μg/g, with values ranging from 0.61 to 31.1 μg/g. The mean T-Hg level decreased in the order Puerto Huila > Puerto Ticuna > Ventura > Nueva Union > Buenos Aires > Santa Lucia > Puerto Nuevo > Caña Brava > Pupuña. Based on recommendations from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA), 99.5% of the samples exceeded the maximum level of 1.0 μg/g. Hg content in human hair was significantly associated with fish consumption (ρ = 0.253; p < 0.001). According to the health survey, at least 24.7% of the volunteers manifested some signs and symptoms of Hg poisoning. In short, these data support the extensive Hg exposure in the environment of the Colombian Amazon, a process that could be impacting the quality of life of its vulnerable indigenous groups. Immediate actions must be taken by competent authorities to protect these communities from Hg poisoning. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

However, there are some historical migratory records of this species on the western slope of the Andes, but the information is poor and scattered. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of the migratory patterns of the Eastern Kingbird, giving more attention to the migratory route throughout the arid ecosystems in western Peru and Chile. We modeled monthly density heatmaps and evaluated the annual migratory movements of the bird in the southern hemisphere using the records available in the Global Biodiversity Information Facility repository. We found that the species frequents the arid ecosystems of western South America often than previously published. We recognized that the species follows the same pattern of migration in both the western and eastern humid areas SouthAmerica; nevertheless, we identified that the species is present year-round in northern South America, mainly in Colombia, with some records during the breeding season (April-August) in Peru and Chile. We strongly recommend the use of citizen science datasets to elucidate the migratory patterns of other boreal migratory bird species. © Sociedade Brasileira de Ornitologia 2020.},

Our study subjects were rural and urban residents in southern Chile. The results indicate low levels of knowledge about birds of prey and mainly positive perceptions, despite the presence of superstitions about raptors. These findings show the importance of socio-cultural dimensions and their implications for environmental education – which should be oriented towards changing attitudes to target species and particularly belief systems which determine attitudes.

In each region, nine orchards, ranging from 1 to 21 years old, were randomly selected and inspected for incidence and severity of tree decline associated with crown and root rot. Soil and symptomatic crown and root tissues were collected and cultured in P5ARP semiselective medium to isolate potential oomycete pathogens, which were identified through morphology and molecularly using ITS sequences in the rDNA gene and beta tubulin gene. The most frequently isolated species was Phytophthora cinnamomi. Pathogenicity tests were conducted with representative oomycete isolates. P. cinnamomi, P. citrophthora, and Pythium ultimum were all pathogenic in J. regia. Nevertheless, only P. cinnamomi and P. citrophthora were pathogenic to English walnut. Py. ultimum caused limited levels of root damage to English walnut seedlings.

Most Chilean cities are located in the central zone, where mediterranean climate predominates with minimal rainfall during the hot summer period. Thus green roofs require an irrigation system to provide sustainable plant growth. The present study evaluated the effect of different irrigation regimes (two irrigations per day; one irrigation per day and four irrigations per week) on the growth of two native species, Haplopappus macrocephalus and Selliera radicans, planted in Talca. The study utilized green roof modules made with recycled and shredded ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA), with a drainage system capable of retaining a portion of the runoff water. Plant survival was 100% in H. macrocephalus and 96% in S. radicans. Plant growth was similar for all irrigation treatments as well as flowering for both species. The only differences observed were in dry matter accumulation for H. macrocephalus, where irrigation once or twice a day increased aerial dry weight compared to irrigation four times a week. In contrast, root dry matter accumulation was similar for all three irrigation treatments. Both species would be suitable for Talca green roof plantings; irrigation can be applied four times per week in order to save water resources without endangering plant growth or flowering. © 2017, Universidad de Tarapaca.

	abstract = {The concentrations of Cu, Cr, Fe, Pb and Zn in thallus of three species of epiphytic lichens were determined: Flavopunctelia flaventior, Phaeophyscia orbicularis and Ramalina ecklonii, collected in three sectors of Talca city (Region of Maule, Chile), which have been exposed to different human activities. The first collection of samples was carried out by Pereira & Tapia. in 1999 and those results were compared with samples collected in 2016. Metal determinations were made by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy, considering the thallus of each lichen as representative sample for analysis. The methodological validation was carried out using certified reference material (SRM-1570). The highest levels of concentration in the three sectors and for the two sampling periods were for Fe > Zn > Pb > Cu > Cr > Cd. In 1999, the range of concentrations of the heavy metals in dry wet varied 335.5-1724 μg/g for iron (Fe); 40.7-209.5 μg/g for zinc (Zn); 10.4-64.2 μg/g for lead (Pb); 10-28.7 μg/g for copper (Cu); 0.6-4.8 μg/g for chromium and 0.1-0.4 μg/g for cadmium (Cd) while in 2016 the ranges were 1356.6-14280.4 μg/g for iron (Fe); 26.8-179.5 μg/g for zinc (Zn); 13.5-102.5 μg/g for lead (Pb); 7.9-36.2 μg/g for copper (Cu); 3.6-24.6 μg/g for chromium and not detected for cadmium (Cd). The samples collected in 2016 generally showed higher concentration levels of Fe, Cu, Cr and Pb than those collected in 1999, especially those corresponding to the central area of tthe city of Talca. According to the results, the species that accumulated more heavy metals were P. orbicularis followed by F. flaventior and last R. ecklonii. It can be concluded that foliose species are potentially better candidates to be used as long-term bioindicators than the fruticose species. The downtown sector of the city is the most polluted due to the presence of tannery industries and the increase of vehicular traffic that the city has had in the last two decades as a result of agricultural development and population growth. © 2018, Universidad de Concepcion.

This species group mainly differs from other Naupactus by the presence of a pair of tubercles at the apex of the elytra. It ranges in Argentina, southern Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay and Uruguay, in areas that belong to the biogeographic provinces of Atlantic, Araucaria and Paraná forests, Yungas, Chaco and Pampa. Naupactus xanthographus is broadly distributed in Argentina, mainly in the Pampean province, and it was introduced in central Chile, where it is considered a serious pest of grapes and several fruit trees. The remaining species are partially sympatric in the subtropical forests of southern Brazil, and N. dissimulator ranges along the gallery forests of Paraná and Uruguay rivers, down to La Plata River. It has been reported damaging citrus and ‘yerba mate’, like N. navicularis and N. dissimilis. The new species N. marvaldiae ranges in southern Brazil and north-eastern Argentina (Misiones), and differs from N. dissimulator, mainly by the very short elytra, the apical tubercles welldeveloped in males and females, the broader front femora, and the different shape of the apex of the penis. The other four species are probably more closely related and they separate from the pair N. dissimulator–N. marvaldiae because of the slightly widened front femora, well-developed corbels of the hind tibiae, and short to indistinct nodulus of the spermatheca. http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:051587DD-37C2-4216-AA61-0E563BB44D64. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {The relationship between the growth of 43-year old specimens of an Abies pinsapo Boiss stand located in the city of Valdivia (Chile) and the climatic variability of this site was studied. The objectives were to define the climatic response function and identify the climatic variables and periods that regulate radial growth rates and to compare the annual radial growth with those characterizing two natural stands of the same species growing in Spain provinces, which, together with Morocco, shelters its last populations. Growth rates in Valdivia, Chile, were similar to or even higher than those in their natural habitat, showing a predilection for warm summers with little rain, as well as for abundant winter precipitation. In relation to the early wood (EW) and late wood (LW) series, the first one was related with prevalent dominant climatic conditions of the previous summer. This may be related to stored food. Late wood showed a climatic signal controlled by dominant conditions of the current growing season. These results indicate that the temperate-rainy climate in Los Ríos Region (Chile), milder than the mountain climate in its original habitat, favors the growth of this species and therefore constitutes an alternative habitat for its conservation. Here, summer temperatures favor its growth, differing from its natural habitat, where soil-water availability is the major factor controlling its growth. This information can be relevant for ex-situ conservation of one of the most severely threatened conifers by climate change and human pressure in the south of the Iberian Peninsula. © 2019, Universidad Austral de Chile.

	abstract = {The unicellular green alga Haematococcus pluvialis accumulates large quantities of astaxanthin, a highly valuable carotenoid pigment in the aquaculture, food, and pharmaceutical industries. Biological diversity within a species with a biotechnological interest allows applying strain selection procedures avoiding genetic manipulation. The aim of this study was to determine growth and carotenogenic capacity among 13 strains isolated from a latitudinal range throughout south-central and southern Chile, in order to know their biological diversity and biotechnological potential. Strains were isolated from rain pools located in public squares and cemeteries of the cities: Concepción, Valdivia, Osorno, Puerto Varas, and Castro. All the Chilean strains were more carotenogenic than the reference strain Steptoe. Physiological attributes differed greatly among the strains. Principal component analysis (PCA) of growth and carotenogenesis parameters grouped the strains into four groups, two of them composed by only one strain (CCM-UdeC-038 and CCM-UdeC- 039). These latter strains were also the most carotenogenic ones, being strain CCM-UdeC-039 the one that accumulated the highest amount of astaxanthin (7 mg astaxanthin L−1 culture) associated to the highest total carotenoid content (1.1 % by dry biomass) and carotenoids/chlorophyll ratio (2.6). These results demonstrate that a great physiological diversity exists at intraspecific level in H. pluvialis (even among strains coming from the same geographical origin), which allows performing genetic improvement by means of simple selection of new strains from nature. Further research will be focused on finding out the culture conditions that optimize the astaxanthin production of the most promising strains. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2015.},

	abstract = {Changes in land-uses and cover are strong drivers of stream degradation worldwide. In Mediterranean ecoregions, land conversion from forest with native species to tree plantations, agricultural, and urban areas have drastically increased in recent years. Here, we examined the influence of land-use types on water quality (physical and chemical variables) and biota (benthic algae, macroinvertebrates, and fishes). We conducted field surveys between December–March 2016 (dry season) in 24 sites located across four land-use types including native vegetation (NV), tree plantation (TP), agriculture (Ag), and urban (Ur) within the Chilean Mediterranean ecoregion. We calculated metrics and multivariate statistics to assess correlations between biological and environmental variables. Significant differences between land-uses were found for environmental/physicochemical variables and the three biotic groups (i.e., benthic algae, macroinvertebrates, and fishes). We found higher chlorophyll-a biomass for TP, Ag, and Ur compared to NV streams. The macroinvertebrate diversity of sensitive taxa (i.e., Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera) and water quality were lower in land draining streams with human uses, other than NV, with the most evident impact found in Ag and Ur streams. NV and TP streams had a lower Diptera density and lower percentage of non-insect taxa. Fish richness and diversity were not affected by land-use. However, cold-water fishes (both native and introduced) were closely associated with NV and TP streams whereas warm-water fishes (mostly introduced) were closely associated with Ag and Ur streams. Multivariate analysis revealed that both local habitat and catchment-scale variables influenced each biological assemblage. Our findings suggest that benthic algae, macroinvertebrates, and fish populations are good indicators of human land-use disturbances, with Ag and Ur areas being the most detrimental for freshwater biota. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

However, changes in characteristics of the surrounding urban morphology could influence the contribution of such green spaces. In particular, bird communities inhabiting small urban parks (SUPs) may be vulnerable, given the high exposure of these spaces to surrounding conditions. In Neotropical cities, the influence of urban-matrix characteristics on bird communities found in SUPs is relatively unknown. In this study, we explored if an increase in surrounding urban matrix variables, such as building densities, average building height, and road coverage around SUPs, negatively influenced the richness and abundance of the bird communities inhabiting them. We tested the effects of matrix and several site-level variables (e.g., vegetation diversity) across 60 SUPs in Santiago, Chile. As the matrix around a SUP had increased building densities, bird richness and abundance of native and insectivorous species decreased and invasive, urban-dweller, and omnivorous species increased. As road coverage increased, both the richness and abundance tended to decrease across all bird categories. For site-level variables, SUP size, distance to nearest SUP, and native vegetation diversity had a significant effect on several bird categories. Our results indicate that city planners may need to take into account both the surrounding urban matrix and site-level characteristics in order to improve bird diversity within SUPs. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic volatile organic compounds (AVOCs) represent the third largest contribution in gaseous emissions in the urban and peri-urban region of Santiago, the capital of Chile. Some of these compounds are toxic or mutagenic, cause serious damage to human health, and decrease plant growth and development. There is little international information related to atmospheric AVOCs in leaf content from trees exposed to specific sources of pollution, and to our knowledge, there is no research on this topic in Chile. The purpose of this work was to study the leaf content of AVOCs from the Organic Range of Gasoline (ORG: range 6–10 C) emitted by local traffic during the austral summer and spring seasons in leaves of two exotic tree species (Liriodendron tulipifera and Platanus × acerifolia). Leaf samples collected around 2 meters height above the ground were pulverized with a cryogenic mill and eleven chemical components were quantified (toluene, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene (1,2,4-TMB), styrene, ethylbenzene, ortho, meta and para-xylenes, naphthalene, 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (1,3,5-TMB), isopropylbenzene, and trichloroethene) using GC-MSD MSD. Benzene was detected but not quantified, because it was always under the quantification limit of the technique. Differences in concentrations were found for type of site exposure, season and tree species. The differences found in leaf content of AVOCs in P. × acerifolia exposed to vehicle traffic suggest that the concentration of these contaminants in leaves may be due to AVOC capturing. Considering the content of AVOCs in leaves and not in the whole individual tree, L. tulipifera presented a higher concentration of total AVOCs than P. × acerifolia for both seasons. The Prop-Equiv and OFP of L. tulipifera were very high in summer, being 13.6 and 14.8 times greater, respectively, than the corresponding values for P. × acerifolia. © Copyright © 2019 Araya, Seelenfreund, Buscaglia, Peña-Ahumada, Vera, Egas and Préndez.},

	abstract = {The first molecular phylogeny of Lynceus (Crustacea: Branchiopoda: Laevicaudata) is presented together with a description of a new species of laevicaudatan branchiopod from Chile, Lynceus huentelauquensis, sp. nov. DNA sequences were obtained from six species of Lynceus using freshly collected specimens from Europe, North America, South America, and Australia and combined with GenBank sequences from previous studies. Specimens of the new species were collected from a pool on the Huentelauquén Plains near Huentelauquén City. Our molecular analyses placed L. huentelauquensis, sp. nov. within Lynceus and close to a cluster of Australian species, and revealed morphological misidentifications, cross-contamination, or incorrect upload in earlier GenBank sequences. L. huentelauquensis, sp. nov. is separated from other Lynceus primarily by the morphology of the rostrum and the male claspers. L. huentelauquensis, sp. nov. is the first described laevicaudatan from Chile, the sixth from South America, and the 13th from the Americas. The morphology of laevicaudatans from the Americas is reviewed and an updated key to the (male) Lynceidae of the region is provided. Our study highlights the necessity of a revision of Laevicaudata using multiple genetic markers as well as thorough morphological studies on a greater number of taxa. © 2019 CSIRO.},

	abstract = {A paucity of ecological research in urban ecosystems in Latin America limits the management of urban areas for biodiversity conservation. In addition, the majority of previous ecological studies in cities have focused on parks, ignoring most part of urban ecosystems. To provide robust scientific evidence for the management of urban areas for bird conservation, we investigate the influence of habitat variables on the abundance of native and exotic bird species in Santiago, Chile. During the reproductive season of 2017-2018, we surveyed birds and habitat variables at 455 points distributed throughout the city. We fit generalized linear models to evaluate the influence of habitat variables on individual bird species abundance. In 905 bird counts, we recorded 35 bird species (31 native and 4 exotic). The abundance ofnative birds (Zenaida auriculata, Elaenia albiceps, Troglodytes aedon, Turdus falcklandii, Zonotrichia capensis and Molothrus bonariensis) increased with woody vegetation cover. Points with greater shrub cover in the microhabitat exhibited a greater abundance of T. falcklandii, Z. capensis and E. albiceps. In contrast to the response of native birds, the abundance of exotic species (Columba livia and Passer domesticus) decreased with vegetation cover. Our results demonstrate the importance of woody vegetation to conserve native bird species in Santiago. Management of habitat that (1) avoids the loss of woody vegetation and (2) aims to increase trees and shrubs in urban areas with low vegetation cover will promote a greater abundance of native birds. © 2019 The author(s).

	abstract = {Urbanization alters community composition, frequently leading to decline in native species abundance and richness. Nevertheless, responses might also depend on trait-based local habitat and landscape-scale filters. In this work, we studied how local characteristics of greenspaces and landscape context at 100 and 1000 m influence taxonomic and functional traits composition of native and alien coccinellids (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) across an urbanization gradient extending from the city of Santiago, Chile, into surrounding rural areas. We found that greenspaces supported a rich community of coccinellids, including many native species, but both native and alien species were negatively affected by urbanization. Local habitat variables were not important predictors of coccinellids richness, abundance or functional traits. On the other hand, landscape composition at both scales did affect coccinellid communities in greenspaces. At both landscape scales, there was variation in the association of coccinellids with landscape variables based on their primary diet, thus, urbanization might differentially affect the ecological service provided by different functional groups of coccinellids. Our results show that greenspaces support a rich community of coccinellids, including many native species, but the degree to which greenspaces conserve these communities depends on the level of urbanization. © 2019 Elsevier GmbH},

	abstract = {Different studies on land use-cover change (LUCC) have revealed substantial loss of native forests in south-central Chile in the last decades. However, little information exists about LUCC in drinking water catchments (DWC) affected by water scarcity. We analyzed the LUCC in 25 catchments that supply water to urban and rural communities in the coastal range of south-central Chile, between 1986 and 2011. Results showed that 21 DWC exhibited an increase in intensity of land uses, from native forest and shrublands to forest plantations of exotic species. A higher rate of deforestation was observed in unprotected catchments (2.7 % ± 1.5 year-1) than in catchments protected by the State (0.5 % ± 0.4 year-1). Our spatio-temporal assessment of LUCC at the catchment scale reveals the high degree of pressure in land condition in critical DWC. It is urgent to develop a landscape planning strategy to conserve drinking water source areas in changing landscapes. © 2017, Universidad Austral de Chile. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The diatom genus Chaetoceros is one of the most abundant and diverse phytoplankton in marine and brackish waters worldwide. Within this genus, Chaetoceros socialis has been cited as one of the most common species. However, recent studies from different geographic areas have shown the presence of pseudo-cryptic diversity within the C. socialis complex. Members of this complex are characterized by curved chains (primary colonies) aggregating into globular clusters, where one of the four setae of each cell curves toward the center of the cluster and the other three orient outwards. New light and electron microscopy observations as well as molecular data on marine planktonic diatoms from the coastal waters off Chile revealed the presence of two new species, Chaetoceros sporotruncatus sp. nov. and C. dichatoensis. sp. nov. belonging to the C. socialis complex. The two new species are similar to other members of the complex (i.e., C. socialis and C. gelidus) in the primary and secondary structure of the colony, the orientation pattern of the setae, and the valve ultrastructure. The only morphological characters that can be used to differentiate the species of this complex are aspects related to resting spore morphology. The two newly described species are closely related to each other and form a sister clade to C. gelidus in molecular phylogenies. We also provide a phylogenetic status along with the morphological characterization of C. radicans and C. cintus, which are genetically related to the C. socialis complex. © 2017 Phycological Society of America},

	abstract = {Population characteristics and carapace growth rates were estimated for green turtles (Chelonia mydas) foraging in Arica Bay, northern Chile, from 2012 to 2016. Within the main foraging area of La Puntilla, an open population of up to 514 individuals was estimated by mark and recapture (Jolly-Seber method), with densities of 20-225 individuals/km2. Captured individuals (n = 159) ranged from 44.6 to 98.6 cm straight carapace length (SCL) with a mean SCL of 64.9 cm (SD 10.8); most turtles were juveniles; however, 10 were adults with SCL > 80 cm (three of these being males). A mean body condition index (BCI) of 1.64 (range 0.34-3.63) indicated healthy population conditions, with mean annual growth rates (AGR) of 4.6 cm/year (SD 2.97). The consistent presence of turtles between 2012 and 2016 and the relatively high abundance compared to the general situation reported for the species in Chile makes Arica Bay the most important feeding congregation of green turtles in the country. The population's healthy state and size, its location within an urban radius, and the multiple human uses of this site represent aspects that must be considered in protection and development plans for the city's coastal border. © 2019 by University of Hawai'i Press.

	abstract = {The coast of mainland Chile extends from 18°S to about 56°S, and is about 4200 km long. In the north, the coast is characterized by continuous, regular, and wave-exposed shores, while to south of 40°S it is highly fragmented, with extensive fjords and small archipelagos with many wave-protected zones. The Humboldt Current System (HCS) determines oceanographic and ecological processes in the northern part, with persistent upwelling fronts and episodic “El Niño” events. In the southern part the southward-flowing Magellan Current is important. Coastal upwelling along the HCS sustains a diverse pelagic and benthic food web structure. Rocky coastal habitats are dominated by large kelp forests and filter-feeding species like reef-forming mussels and tunicates. The main coastal habitats along the coast of Chile are rocky shores, sandy beaches, coastal wetlands, and dunes. The main populated zones are concentrated between 33°S to 35°S in central Chile, with economically important trading ports. Sewage discharges from large cities have the potential to increase nutrients levels in nearshore habitats causing localized eutrophication. Mining activities in northern Chile contaminate coastal waters, while in the south intensive aquaculture affects the fjord ecosystem. Also, subsistence harvesting (of kelps, molluscs, fish) is dramatically reducing the abundance of top consumers or habitat-forming species. The diverse and productive coastal marine ecosystems are used by different socioeconomic activities and exposed to interventions which are potentially harmful. Ecosystem services should be managed, and necessary interventions carefully planned. Achieving sustainable use of natural marine resources and coastal ecosystem integrity is challenging, and a basic understanding of ecosystem responses to direct human impacts and global climate change require better monitoring strategies. The establishment of a marine reserve “Humboldt Current System” would be a major step toward this goal. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Following a large-scale phylogenetic study of the lichenized genus Cora (Basidiomycota: Agaricales: Hygrophoraceae), we formally describe 70 new species, honouring the seventieth birthday of David Leslie Hawksworth, one of the preeminent figures in mycology and lichenology in the past 50 years. Based on an updated phylogeny using the ITS fungal barcoding locus, we now recognize 189 taxa in a genus that until recently was considered to represent a single species; including this contribution, 92 of these are formally recognized, including five taxa based on historical names or collections that have not been sequenced. Species of Cora can be recognized by a combination of morphological (size, colour, lobe configuration, surface hairs, hymenophore size and shape), anatomical (thallus thickness, cortex structure, photobiont type, hyphal papillae), and ecogeographical features (substrate, habitat, distribution), and a keytable allowing the identification of all accepted taxa is provided.

	abstract = {The effect of urban trees as a noise mitigating element was determined on Alameda Avenue in the city of Talca, Chile, a Mediterranean continental area. Maximum and minimum noise, especially generated from vehicles, was recorded at 13 points in four sections of the avenue for twelve days, three times a day at different distances from the edge of the street way, which generated a total of 2,080 noise records. At each point a circular plot of 201 m2 was established to determine tree and shrub coverage. The results showed significant differences of noise between the classes of coverage; however there was no relationship significant between the noise level and the increase in coverage, which can be explained by the large amplitude in the noise registers. The vegetation located at 6.5 meters from the sound source shows lower levels of noise when the coverage is increased, proving the environmental function of the vegetation in the mitigation of this pollutant agent. Regarding theses of the findings, it is necessary to implement public policies that consider urban planning, incorporating in its design greater and better availability of tree species and that certain public space are located away from sources of noise pollution. © 2019, Universidad Nacional de Cuyo.

	abstract = {The expansion of cities promotes the replacement of local biotas with exotic species causing a decrease in global diversity. As urbanization continues to expand, efforts directed towards the conservation within urban landscapes could support regional biodiversity conservation. The biogeographic region of central Chile displays a native flora of global importance because of its high endemism. Up to date, studies analysing the composition of the floras within the cities are scarce. The present study aims at characterizing the compositional and distributional patterns of the ornamental flora of five cities of central Chile (La Serena, Valparaíso, Santiago, Rancagua, and Talca). For this purpose, we sampled several streets and squares recording all woody species. The species were then characterized by their biogeographical origin and incidence. It was recorded 302 species of which approx. 86% were exotic and 14% were native, a consistent pattern found in the five cities studied; these results contrast with the European urban flora, where native species can usually overcome 50% of the plant species. Almost half of the exotic species had their origin in Asia (including Australasia, Temperate, and Tropical Asia), Europe, and North America. Consequently, the representation of the regional flora within the urban context is low for central Chile, with the native species registered, accounting for only 0.81% of the total species described for the country. Urban habitats could support regional biodiversity conservation, so a shift towards sustainable urban planning could promote local biological conservation. © 2018, Universidad de Concepcion.

	abstract = {Landscape composition and heterogeneity are considered important factors for enhancing biodiversity and their associated ecosystem services in human-modified landscapes. Despite their roles in pest suppression in agricultural areas, insectivorous bats have been poorly represented in studies assessing the effects of landscape structural changes, particularly in the Neotropics. We evaluated how the composition and heterogeneity of the landscape, at several spatial scales, influenced the diversity and activity of aerial insectivorous bats in organic vineyards. Bat activity was quantified using acoustic surveys at 16 vineyards distributed across the central zone of Chile, where landscape composition and heterogeneity were determined by spatial analysis (GIS). Data were analyzed using partial least square regressions (PLS). The diversity and activity of aerial insectivorous bats in vineyards increased with the compositional and configurational heterogeneity of the landscape. Bat diversity and species richness in vineyards increased as the area covered by native vegetation increased, and urban areas decreased. Total bat activity, feeding activity and the activity of the dominant species T. brasiliensis increased with the diversity of cover types in the landscape, and also as the area covered by annual crops and rural areas increased. This study highlights the importance of agricultural landscape composition and heterogeneity for aerial insectivorous bats in organic vineyards. Effective conservation efforts and management strategies in this crop should aim to increase cover diversification at the landscape scale. In addition, retaining native forest remnants around or within vineyards may promote bat conservation and their role as suppressors of crop pests in these production landscapes. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Markham's Storm-Petrel Oceanodroma markhami is one of the least known seabirds in the world. Between 2013 and 2017, we conducted an extensive ground based survey to locate nests, confirm nesting colonies and, whenever possible, characterize Markham's Storm-Petrel breeding phenology. The survey was conducted in the Atacama Desert, northern Chile, covering the area between Arica (18.240°S, 70.509°W) and Taltal (25.050°S, 70.486°W). Our study led to the discovery of two new colonies and to a six-fold increase in the estimate of the breeding population at the previously known Arica colony: a more accurate estimate of 55,308 pairs. Prior to this study, 9362 breeding pairs were known to occur in two colonies. Currently, the colonies of Arica (34,684 nests), Pampa La Perdiz (624 nests) and Salar Grande (20,000 nests) represent almost 95% of the known breeding population. We found that the colony of Arica has a different breeding phenology to that of the Pampa Perdiz and Salar Grande colonies, which could be due to differences in their food phenology. None of the colonies lie within designated protected areas and they strongly overlap with current and planned mining, wind farms and power plants in northern Chile. Apart from the disturbance caused by destruction of habitat and nests, these developments are also important sources of artificial light that cause the grounding of fledglings, after which many of them probably die from the collision impact or predation. It is vital to ensure the conservation of this species by protecting their breeding grounds and by reducing the light pollution not only in the colonies, but also at the access points to the colonies and at the big cities nearby. © 2019 Nederlandse Ornithologische Unie.

	abstract = {The chemical composition of submicron particles (aerodynamic diameter Da < 1.0 μm) was investigated at three locations in the Santiago Metropolitan Region (SMR), Chile. Measurements campaigns were conducted in winter and spring 2016, at representative sites of a rural, urban, and urban receptor environment. Instrumentation consisted of an optical analyzer to determine Black Carbon (BC) and the Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor (ACSM) to measure concentrations of particulate chloride (Cl-), nitrate (NO3-), sulfate (SO42-), ammonium (NH4+), and non-refractory carbonaceous species (organics). Complementary data, such as ozone concentration and meteorological parameters were obtained from the public air quality network. Results showed that in both the winter and spring seasons the organics predominated in the mass of submicron particles. This fraction was followed in decreasing order by NO3-, NH4+, BC, SO42-, and Cl-. The highest average organics concentrations were measured in winter at the urban (32.2 μg m-3) and urban receptor sites (20.1 μg m-3). In winter, average concentrations of both NO3-and NH4+ were higher at the urban receptor site (12.3 and 4.5 μg m-3, respectively) when compared to the urban site (6.4 and 3.1 μg m-3, respectively). In general, all the measured species were present in higher concentrations during winter, excepting SO42-, which was the only one that increased during spring. The transition toward spring was also associated with an acidification of the aerosol at the rural and urban receptor site, while at the urban site the aerosol was observed alkaline. The highest average ozone concentration during both the winter and spring seasons were recorded at the urban receptor site (7.2 and 24.0 ppb, respectively). The study reports data showing that the atmosphere in the SMR has a considerable load of particulate organic compounds, NO3-and NH4+, which are in higher concentrations at urban sites during the winter season. Based on wind patterns and the hourly profiles of chemical species, the study suggests that during daytime the polluted air masses from the urban center can move to the northeast part of the region (namely urban receptor site) leading to the formation of submicron particles as well as photochemical ozone. © 2018 Tagle, Reyes, Vásquez, Carbone, Saarikoski, Timonen, Gramsch and Oyola.},

	abstract = {Urban trees and the services they provide (e.g., evapotranspirational cooling, shading, recreation, carbon storage, air pollution filtering) can have major effects on the microclimate of a city, although the growth conditions are often inadequate to ensure tree vitality and growth, negatively affecting their beneficial effects. In a worldwide dendrochronological study on ten urban tree species in four climatic zones, the growth and impacts of common urban tree species were assessed. This paper focuses on the results for Robinia pseudoacacia L. in the Mediterranean climate city of Santiago de Chile, highlighting the faster growth of the studied black locust trees since 1960 than its growth in the years before 1960. Furthermore, black locust displayed the best growth when situated closer to the city center than the city periphery and when in the northern and western parts of Santiago de Chile. The species characteristics of black locust also revealed an immediate negative growth reaction to drought events, followed by a rapid recovery, which was similarly influenced by the direction from and distance to the city center of the growing site. The results underline the overall worldwide findings on urban tree growth that indicate that a city climate with an extended growing season and increased temperatures can lead to improved growth of urban trees in the Mediterranean climatic zone. However, with increased growth, more rapid ageing and tree death might follow, leading to increased costs for new plantings and tree management. © 2018, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Facultad de Agronomia e Ingenieria Forestal.

	abstract = {The southernmost archipelago of the Americas is dominated by invasive mammals that outnumber their native counterparts. Despite the relatively low ability of most invasive mammals to cross cold sea water channels, invaders are apparently colonizing new islands. Our objective was to provide an assessment of the expansion of invasive mammals within these sub-Antarctic ecosystems, determine whether human-mediated movement of invasive species is a plausible dispersal mechanism, and identify areas likely to be colonized in the near future. We report a decade of fieldwork (2006–2017) in 44 sites on 13 islands within the Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve including opportunistic and systematic camera trapping, carnivore diet, questionnaires, small mammal trapping, and walks/transects. We found new records of invasive mammals on seven islands, particularly for American mink (Neovison vison) and American beaver (Castor canadensis). Interviews with fishermen showed that mink, dogs (Canis familiaris), and small rodents are likely passengers in vessels. Finally, species distribution models revealed that the putative invasive-free Cape Horn National Park (55°S) is suitable for several invasive species, suggesting a high risk of invasion if species are introduced. We conclude that it is urgent to implement barriers to dispersal to prevent further invasion. In the case of dogs and cats (Felis catus), the first step should be control actions that target pet owners. Finally, we highlight the need of systematic, long-term biodiversity monitoring and citizen science in the Cape Horn Archipelago and common conservation guidelines for the terrestrial sub-Antarctic ecosystems. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Organic matter removal in a horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetland (HSSF) treating wastewater is associated with the presence of bacteria and archaea. These organisms perform anaerobic microbial processes such as methanogenesis, which can lead to methane emissions. The aim of this study was to evaluate methane production and characterize the bacterial and archaeal communities found in HSSFs treating secondary urban wastewater during cold and warm seasons. The pilot system used in this study corresponds to four HSSFs, two planted with Phragmites australis (HSSF−Phr) and two planted with Schoenoplectus californicus (HSSF−Sch), the monitoring was carried out for 1335 days. Removal efficiencies for organic matter (biological and chemical oxygen demand) and total and volatile suspended solids were evaluated in each HSSF. Moreover, biomass from each HSSF was sampled during warm and cold season, and methane productions determined by Specific Methanogenic Activity assays(maximum) (SMAm). In the same samples, the quantification and identification of bacteria and archaea were performed. The results showed that the degradation of organic matter (53–67% BOD5 and 51–62% COD) and suspended solids (85–93%) was not influenced by seasonal conditions or plant species. Potential methane production from HSSF-Sch was between 20 and 51% higher than from HSSF-Phr. Moreover, potential methane production during warm season was 3.4–42% higher than during cold season. The quantification of microorganisms in HSSFs, determined greater development of bacteria (38%) and archaea (50–57%) during the warm season. In addition, the species Schoenoplectus californicus has a larger number of bacteria (4–48%) and archaea (34–43%) than Phragmites australis. The identification of microorganisms evidenced the sequences associated with bacteria belong mainly to Firmicutes (42%), Proteobacteria (33%) and Bacteroidetes (25%). The archaea were represented primarily by Methanosarcinales, specifically Methanosaeta (75%) and Methanosarcina (16%). The community structure of the methanogenic archaea in HSSFs did not change throughout the seasons or plant species. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

Urban expansion and climate change are jeopardizing the conservation of these ecosystems with a high degree of endemic species. In the city of Lima, a fog oasis formation, Lomas de Quebrada Verde, has been under local conservation during 20 years; however, conservation has been empirical and without scientific support. The objectives of the present study were to: (i) describe a year-round spatio-temporal pattern of the plant diversity along the study area, and (ii) relate plant diversity and composition with environmental variables [altitude, slope, soil gravimetric moisture (θg) and soil organic matter (SOM)]. A marked seasonality was found in plant diversity, having two pronounced seasons, a dry of low diversity during March and May 2013 and January 2014, and a wet season of greater diversity that occurred between the July and November 2013 evaluations. Altitude, θg and SOM were positively correlated with canopy cover, but not with plant diversity indexes (Shannon-Weaver and species richness). Altitude, θg and SOM were found to have an effect on shaping the plant community composition. Herbaceous species were dominant in the low altitude and low SOM belt. Whereas woody species such as Croton alnifolius and Heliotropium arborescens were more abundant in the higher altitude belt, where SOM was greater and humidity was more persistent along the year. © International Society for Tropical Ecology.},

	abstract = {Free-ranging dogs (Canis familiaris) significantly threaten wildlife, including endangered species. Although this problem resembles threats from other invasive animals, managing roaming dogs is even more fraught due to their close association with humans. Here we use interviews (n = 166) to document patterns of dog ownership and care and to measure public attitudes toward management strategies to control free-roaming dogs that threaten wildlife in rural areas of southern Chile. We compare attitudes toward lethal control and fines in scenarios where dogs attack livestock, children or wild animals or enter protected areas. We also test for variation in attitudes according to gender, age, education and proximity to urban areas. Most respondents (98.1%) opposed lethal control for at least one scenario and they were more likely to accept killing dogs that attacked sheep than those attacking wildlife. Similarly, support for fines was higher when dogs attacked livestock or people versus wild animals. Respondents consistently favored fining the owner over eliminating the problem dog. When asked about their management preferences, many respondents indicated that the movement of problem dogs—including to a lesser extent those threatening wildlife—should be restricted. However, in practice most dog-owners allowed one or more of their dogs to move freely at least part of the time. Finally, the wildlife species of concern mattered, e.g. 40% thought no action was necessary when dogs attack foxes, but this dropped to 12% for pudu (a small deer). In sum, participants had significantly more concern for livestock and human safety than for wildlife protection. We close by discussing management and policy implications. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Wild cockroaches are often described as abundant and diverse insects from wet tropical zones; however, they can also be found in arid and semiarid areas. It is proposed that in these drier environments cockroach survival may dependent on its tight association with native plant species. In this work, using bait trapping and active collection methods, we surveyed cockroach species along central Chile coastal scrubland; the southern limit of the semiarid Mediterranean Matorral biome in the Neotropical Region (32° S). Based on morphological and DNA barcoding methods we found that our collected cockroaches belonged to native species Moluchia brevipennis (Saussure, 1864) (Blattodea: Ectobiidae). Furthermore, thanks to field sampling, we noticed for the first time that M. brevipennis predominantly can be found in patches of native vegetation from Matorral biome, for instance, associated to endemic plant species from Puya (Bromeliaceae) genus, where we recorded these wild cockroaches feeding on flowers at dusk. Under the light of these findings, we discuss the relevance of the association between M. brevipennis and native plants for its survival in this semiarid habitat, its potential ecological function and the ongoing hazards for native insect species resulting from nearby urban sprawl in coastal central Chile. © 2017 Sociedade Brasileira de Entomologia},

	abstract = {The noble false widow Steatoda nobilis (Thorell, 1875) has established thriving populations in urban centres throughout England and Wales since it was accidentally imported from the Canary Islands and Madeira to Britain over a century ago. In recent years, Steatoda nobilis has colonised parts of Western Europe, California, Chile and the Middle East. In Ireland, Steatoda nobilis was first recorded in 1999 from a single location in Co Wicklow. The present study examines the current range and main habitats of Steatoda nobilis in Ireland and assesses its potential as an inva- sive species by documenting its reproductive rate. Additionally, we present photographic material illustrating the intraspecific phenotypic variations exhibited by Steatoda nobilis to assist in correct identification of this species by the public. Our data shows that Steatoda nobilis is an extremely pro- lific, resilient species with distinct synanthropic affinities. This species currently occurs in at least sixteen Irish counties with the largest populations observed in the greater Dublin area, where it has become widespread in buildings and on street furniture. Steatoda nobilis seems to be currently absent from natural, undisturbed habitats such as woodlands, bogs and grassland. We suggest that due to its comparatively fast reproductive rate, long life span and year-round activity, Steatoda nobilis might have a detrimental impact on native urban-dwelling spiders. © Royal Irish Academy.},

	abstract = {Tree diversity is one of the most important components of urban ecosystems, because it provides multiple ecological benefits and contributes to human well-being. However, the distribution of urban trees may be spatially segregated and change over time. To provide insights for a better distribution of tree diversity in a socially segregated city, we evaluated spatial segregation in the abundance and diversity of trees by socioeconomic group and their change over a 12-year period in Santiago, Chile. Two hundred vegetation plots were sampled across Santiago in 2002 and 2014. We found that overall abundance and diversity of urban trees for the entire city were stable over 12 years, whereas species richness and abundance of native tree species increased. There was segregation in tree species richness and abundance by socioeconomic group, with wealthier areas having more species and greater abundance of trees (for all tree species and native species) than poorer ones. Tree community composition and structure varied with socioeconomic group, but we found no evidence of increased homogenization of the urban forest in that 12 years. Our findings revealed that although tree diversity and abundance for the entire city did not change in our 12-year period, there were important inequities in abundance and diversity of urban trees by socioeconomic group. Given that 43% of homes in Santiago are in the lower socioeconomic areas, our study highlights the importance of targeting tree planting, maintenance and educational programs in these areas to reduce inequalities in the distribution of trees. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH},

	abstract = {Research on urban forests has expanded in the last 30 years in the US, Canada, Europe, and Australia. Nonetheless, urban forestry has been explored to much less extent in the Latin America and the Caribbean region, despite being one of the most urbanized and biodiverse regions in the world. We address this gap by providing a baseline understanding of urban forest research in the region based on a systematic review of the academic literature. Of the 55,000 studies found, 195 were selected for review, and 182 were analysed and synthesized. These studies came from 13 countries and were published from 1970 to mid-2018 (inclusive) in English, Spanish, and Portuguese. Almost half of the studies were based in Brazil, followed by Mexico and Chile. To comparatively assess article output by country, we accounted for country population and Brazil, Chile, Nicaragua, and Puerto Rico had higher than average per capita article output. Most articles were ecological studies (64%) that used field surveys (58%) to research urban vegetation diversity. Most ecological studies did not include any social or management considerations. Only a few studies focused on spatiotemporal dynamics (12%) or the direct opinions of stakeholders (9%). We observed a notable increase in article output from the region during the last decade. The units of analysis targeted by these studies mostly focused on single trees in public areas (streets and parks). Understanding urban forests regionally could be strengthened by scaling up research across multiple units of analysis and across regional cities, which could provide a better understanding of regional spatiotemporal dynamics. To respond to current global trends and nurture regional strengths, research could also focus on a wider range of ecosystem services provided by urban forests, and the relationship of urban forests with poverty, crime, climate vulnerability, biodiversity loss, and social equity. These findings can inform key stakeholders in the region managing urban forests and trees about research trends and gaps to be filled. This article shows that the region indeed has an important body of research in urban forestry that should be recognized in global assessments. © 2019 Elsevier GmbH},

	abstract = {The increase in human population and domestic pets, such as cats, are generating important consequences in terms of habitat loss and pathogen pollution of coastal ecosystems with potential to generate negative impacts in marine biodiversity. Toxoplasma gondii is the etiological agent of zoonotic disease toxoplasmosis, and is associated with cat abundance and anthropogenic disturbance. The presence of T. gondii oocysts in the ocean has negatively affected the health status of the threatened Southern sea otter (Enhydra lutris nereis) populations. The present study analyzed seroprevalence and presence of T. gondii DNA in American mink (Neovison vison), Southern river otters (Lontra provocax) and domestic cats (Felis silvestris catus) in four different areas in Southern Chile comprising studies in rivers and lakes in Andean foothills and mountains, marine habitat and island coastal ecosystems. Mean seroprevalence of T. gondii in the study was 64% of 151 total animals sampled: 59% of 73 American mink, 77% of 13 Southern river otters, 68% of 65 domestic cats and in two of two kodkods (Leopardus guigna). Toxoplasma gondii DNA was detected in tissues from one American mink and one Southern river otter. The present study confirms the widespread distribution of T. gondii in Southern Chile, and shows a high exposure of semiaquatic mustelids and domestic cats to the parasite. Cats and anthropogenic disturbance have a role in the maintenance of T. gondii infection in ecosystems of southern Chile. © 2018 Barros et al.

	abstract = {The aquaculture of yellowtail kingfish Seriola lalandi, is now expanding worldwide. Production is conducted in two very different types of commercial facilities: predominately in sea cages in Australia, Mexico, Chile and Hawaii; and in indoor facilities in Europe. With expansion, there is concordant commercial interest to develop genetically improved stocks for production. However, there is a great paucity of genetic information about this species. Knowledge gaps include accurate genetic parameter estimates (i.e., from large sample sizes) that are essential to develop accurate and efficient selection indices. Specifically we require accurate information on non-growth traits (such as parasite load and deformities) and their correlations with growth traits (body weight and fork length), and information on any genotype by environment (G × E) interactions between the two major growing systems to determine whether a single or multiple selection programs are required. Here we address all these fundamental genetic knowledge gaps and provide, for the first time: relatively accurate genetic parameter estimates based on approximately 1400 genotyped and phenotyped animals; and preliminary tests for G × E interactions between growth in sea cages vs land tanks. The heritability estimates were moderate and significant (0.42 ± 0.10) for growth traits, whereas heritability estimates for non-growth traits were low (0.01–0.06). The genetic correlation between body weight and fork length was positive and close to one (0.98); in contrast, the correlation between growth traits with occurrence of fluke and deformity were not significant. The genetic correlations for growth traits between two culture environments were high (0.92–0.97); they were however, associated with large standard errors. In summary, the new set of genetic parameters obtained from this study provide accurate information that is essential to develop genetically improved stocks of yellowtail kingfish for commercial production. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

The results indicate that there are at least 297 taxa in the area, belonging to 293 species, 183 genera and 74 families. The best represented families are Asteraceae, Fabaceae and Poaceae. The species richness in relation to the area is greater than expected in central Chile (226-272), where 272 (92.8%) are native, of which 145 (53.3%) are endemic to Chile and 21 (7.2%) are foreign. The predominant Raunkiaer life forms were hemicryptophytes (26.4%), terophytes (23.5%) and camephytes (17.7%). Ten species were officially classified in some categories of conservation, five of them as “vulnerable”, they are Citronella mucronata, Eriosyce aurata, Placea ornata, Porlieria chilensis and Prosopis chilensis.

The genus Promops (Gervais, 1855) is a poorly known group of molossid bats, with three species widely distributed in Central and South America. We report for the first time the species Promops davisoni in Chile. Identification was based on echolocation calls obtained at the Azapa and Lluta valleys and compared to reference calls from Tacna, Peru. We report the species as far as 127 km south of the previous published southernmost record in Pampa Alta, Peru. In addition we obtained an individual found at the Anzota caves, near the city of Arica. The species is found on the coast and in the fluvial valleys of Northern Chile, with altitudes ranging from sea level to 822 m a.s.l. We propose that the distribution of P. davisoni may extend further south, to the locality of Tana in the Tarapacá region, based on the capacity of the species to cross distances of over 100 km over large desert areas. With this species, we increase the known bat fauna of Chile to 14 species, and the bat fauna of the Arica and Parinacota region to nine species. © SAREM, 2018.},

	abstract = {The Noble False Widow, Steatoda nobilis (Thorell, 1875) (Araneae, Theridiidae), is, due to its relatively large size and potential medical importance, one of the most notable invasive spider species worldwide. Probably originating from the Canary Islands and Madeira, the species is well established in Western Europe and large parts of the Mediterranean area and has spread recently into California and South America, while Central European populations were not known until 2011. We report on long-time observations that reveal that at least two flourishing populations in Germany (Cologne) have been present for over five years, while in Ecuador one population has been observed between 2014 and 2018 and several other records were made in other parts of the country. Data obtained from the British Spider Recording Scheme demonstrate that the species moved significantly northwards since the report of the first populations in the very South of England, after several decades of relative stasis. The sudden northward expansion highly correlates with a massive rise in press coverage of the species. In the Americas, S. nobilis is currently known from four countries (USA, Chile, Ecuador, Colombia), and available DNA barcoding data obtained for specimens from this area suggest that multiple introductions occurred within each country. Using ecological niche modeling, we identified suitable climate regions for the species and discuss possible reasons for its current spread. We propose that seaside cities and villages with a temperate oceanic or Mediterranean climate are especially favourable potential habitats for S. nobilis and will face the highest colonization pressure in the future, while tropical upland regions with temperate climates are also vulnerable to invasion by S. nobilis. © Tobias Bauer et al.},

	abstract = {Among a series of exotic pests that have been reported in Chile, Xanthogaleruca luteola Müller (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), a defoliating insect of elms (Ulmus spp.), is causing important damage in urban trees in central Chile. Leaves from Schinus molle L. (Anacardiaceae), an interesting South American plant, were characterized and compared physically and chemically through proximal analysis. Also, the insecticidal effects of ethanol and water extracts from young and mature leaves of S. molle were evaluated on third instar larvae of X. luteola at concentrations of 0.5-4.3% w/v. Water and lipid contents presented the greatest differences in both leaf maturity stages. At 12. d, the maximum concentrations obtained with ethanol and water from young and mature leaves caused mean mortalities of 89 and 67, and 78 and 63%, respectively. The lowest 50% lethal concentration was 1.28% w/v, obtained at the 7th day of evaluation with the ethanol extract from young leaves. Hence, extracts from S. molle leaves may have a potential use as a bioinsecticide in Integrated Pest Management plans against X. luteola and other similar pests defoliating urban trees, to decrease the risk of using conventional pesticides in public areas. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {During the 2014 growing season, 20 to 30 cm brown stringy rot at basal stems and wilt of plants was found at R5.9-R6 stage of sunflower (Helianthus annulus) variety LD 5009 in Chayouzhongqi, Siziwangqi, Xinghe, and Huade areas of Wulanchabu City, Inner Mongolia, China. The average disease incidence was between 10 and 15%. Tiny (0.30 to 2.68 mm), black, round sclerotia were observed on the infected stems. Although sunflower white mold caused by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum has been observed in this region before, the sclerotia observed on the diseased plants were smaller than those produced by S. sclerotiorum. From a total of 171 samples, seven were chosen randomly for pathogen identification. Tiny sclerotia collected from each infected stem were surface-sterilized in 75% alcohol for 30 s, and in 0.5% NaClO for 3 min, then placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA) and incubated for 72 h at 20 to 24°C without light. The emerging mycelia were hyphal-tipped three times and subcultured on PDA. The sclerotial morphology resembled those of S. minor Jagger (Kohn 1979). To confirm the species molecularly, total genomic DNA was isolated from mycelia. The internal transcribed spacer of nuclear rDNA was amplified with PCR using the primer pair ITS1 (5′-TCCGTAGGTGAACCTGCGG-3′) and ITS4 (5′-TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3′) (White et al. 1990). The ITS sequences of all seven isolates were the same and 99% identical to those of S. minorsequence deposited in the GenBank database (KF859929.1). One ITS sequence from this study was deposited in GenBank and assigned accession number KP340982. Pathogenicity was tested by using seven purified isolates as follow: 8-week-old sunflower plants (two plants per 7-cm diameter pot; 10 plants per isolate) were inoculated using the stem inoculation method. Stem inoculation was performed by wounding the stem near soil line using a sterilized toothpick, then 9-mm diameter PDA plugs with actively growing mycelium were placed on the wound sites. A plain PDA plug without mycelium was used as a control. Inoculation sites on all tested plants were wrapped with plastic to maintain moisture, and all the inoculation plants were kept under a 16-h photoperiod with temperatures of 20 to 25°C and 40% relative humidity. Water-soaked lesions were observed at the inoculation sites of all plants 2 days post inoculation (dpi). The lesion expanded along the stem, and white mycelium and also black tiny sclerotia were observed at the infection sites 5 dpi. At 7 dpi, plants withered and lodged. No symptoms were observed on the control plants. The fungus was consistently reisolated from the inoculated stem and tiny sclerotia formed on PDA plates were consistent with S. minor. Although S. minor causing sunflower white mold has been reported in Australia, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, Kenya, New Zealand, Spain, and the United States (Farr and Rossman 2014), to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of S. minor-caused sunflower white mold in China. Because potato is the main rotated crop with sunflower in these regions, it is believed that the S. minor on sunflower was from infected potato. This finding is important to guide the local farmers to choose the right rotated crop and to provide a new research topic for local plant pathologists. © 2016, American Phytopathological Society.

This study focused on characterising the diversity, composition and distribution of native and alien ruderal species present in different suburbs of Santiago de Chile. We found that plant assemblages of ruderal species were characterised by a higher proportion of alien species (69 taxa), whose original distribution corresponds to the Mediterranean Basin (46 taxa), and a low representation of native species (14 taxa). The results show that the spatial distribution of weeds within Santiago was not random, because two clusters were found based on patterns of compositional similarity. Further research should be undertaken to determine the cause of this phenomenon that probably obeys historical and ecological factors such as the past use of soils or urban landscape ornamentation programs. © 2015, Universidad de Concepcion.

	abstract = {In Chile, Citronella mucronata is a tree species classified as “nearly endangered”, highlighting the lack of quantitative information about their populations. The aim of this study was to provide knowledge about C. mucronata populations in secondary forests of Nothofagus obliqua in the Andes foothills of Maule region, central Chile. Specifically the goal was to examine the presence, abundance and associability of C. mucronata and its relation to landscape variables of the Andes foothills. A forest inventory was conducted with the setup of 197 clusters with five plots each. Moreover, a computation of a high resolution geomorphological index was obtained based on LiDAR remote sensing, which allowed establishing geographical distribution patterns of the species. In the sampling area, C. mucronata was present in 31.1%, the average abundance was 117 trees per hectare and the mean altitudinal distribution was 1.149 m a.s.l. with a 142 m interquartile range of the altitude reached preferably in well-drained areas as evidenced by the landform index values. Citronella mucronata was slightly associated with Aextoxicon punctatum, Aristotelia chilensis, Austrocedrus chilensis, Azara petiolaris, Cryptocarya alba, Laurelia sempervirens, Lomatia dentata, Luma apiculata, Maytenus boaria, Nothofagus obliqua, Persea lingue, Podocarpus salignus and Quillaja saponaria and not associated with Drimys winteri, Escallonia pulverulenta, Lithraea caustica, Lomatia hirsuta or Myrceugenia exsucca.

This study statistically and spatially analyzed the spatio-temporal dynamics of Santiago, Chile's urban forest using tree and plot-level data from permanent plots from 2002 to 2014. We found mortality, ingrowth, and tree cover remained stable over the analysis period and similar patterns were observed for basal area (BA) and biomass. However, tree cover increased, and was greater in the highest socioeconomic stratum neighborhoods while it dropped in the medium and low strata. Growth rates for the five most common tree species averaged from 0.12 to 0.36 cm· year-1. Spatially, tree biomass and BA were greater in the affluent, northeastern sections of the city and in southwest peri-urban areas. Conversely, less affluent central, northwest, and southern areas showed temporal losses in BA and biomass. Overall, we found that Santiago's urban forest follows similar patterns as in other parts of the world; affluent areas tend to have more and better managed urban forests than poorer areas, and changes are primarily influenced by social and ecological drivers. Nonetheless, care is warranted when comparing urban forest structural metrics measured with similar sampling-monitoring approaches across ecologically disparate regions and biomes. © 2016 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Background: The explosive growth of urbanisation in Mediterranean ecosystems in Chile has favoured the rapid expansion of exotic plant species, yet factors driving these invasion patterns in adjacent natural areas remain poorly assessed. Aims: To assess how distance to a suburban/wildland border, habitat type, site-scale disturbance and woody plant cover of native species influences the diversity of exotic species in a natural area surrounding the city of Santiago, Chile. Methods: Three watersheds were chosen, and the diversity of exotic species was assessed in 36 100-m-long transects, equally distributed over two distance categories and three habitats. For each transect, we measured woody plant cover of native species and frequency of rabbit faeces as a measure of competitive exclusion and site-scale disturbance, respectively. Results: Species diversity decreased as the distance from the suburban/wildland border increased, and it was found to be higher in north-facing habitats compared to south-facing and alluvial habitats. Neither native woody plant cover nor frequency of rabbit faeces had an effect on species diversity. Conclusions: The current pattern of exotic plant species in this natural area is mainly influenced by the distance to suburban border and habitat type. An adequate management of conditions favouring exotic species in suburban/wildland border may prevent the spread of these into natural areas next to urban settings. © 2014 Botanical Society of Scotland and Taylor & Francis.},

	abstract = {After an extensive two-year long research effort, the results document the diversity of vascular plants that grow in the public spaces of Santiago, Chile. We analyze the taxonomic composition, life-forms and phytogeographic origin of the vascular flora of Santiago and, finally, we compare the results with those of urban areas in the Northern Hemisphere. We identified 508 species, 100 families, and 338 genera. The families that showed the greatest richness were Asteraceae and Poaceae. We found that at least 85.1% of the species are exotic. The life-forms are similarly represented, although chamaephytes and geophytes are poorly represented. We conclude that the composition of the urban flora of Santiago differs from that of most Northern Hemisphere cities, due to the increased presence of exotic species, which is likely a consequence of the historical and cultural patterns of ornamentation. Therefore it is likely that this urban area would be an adverse environment for the establishment and development of native species. © 2016 Universidad de Concepcion. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Greenitude helps to beautify urban environments and is used to improve the urbanites' quality of life. Native trees and medicinal herb species are essential components in Latin American front and backyards. They can be found as hedges and flourishing bushes in gardens, in small vases on terraces and balconies, in vacant urban plots, and in peripheral lots and farms. They constitute a valuable resource for low-income residents and a source of alternative medicine for many. In addition central markets and weekly fairs provide a wide variety of wild species used in treatments for mild or chronic diseases, which are well-known by Latin American citizens. The paper presents a comparative study carried out over the course of a decade in Lima (Peru), Santiago (Chile), Río Cuarto (Argentina), Colonia del Sacramento (Uruguay), Belen and S. Louis (Brazil), Havana (Cuba), San José (Costa Rica) and Mexico City (Mexico). The objectives of the ethno-geographic study are twofold: to report successes in natural resources management at a local level as paradoxes of globalisation and to publicise how cultivated front and backyards contribute to build more resilient urban agglomerations, benefitting both the society and the environment, because traditional healing practices and ethno-botanical knowledge are important legacies for future generations. © 2012 WIT Press.},

The tree is restricted to a small geographical area of the coast of central Chile, where it is in danger of extinction. Its edible fruits and excellent quality wood have been known from the earliest records of the species in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. This review consolidates many publications that are dispersed in the literature, covering aspects of taxonomy, morphology, systematics, propagation, biogeography, ecology, conservation and ethnobotany. Large gaps are present in our knowledge of the species, since many cited publications provide only brief descriptions or statements on diverse aspects of the tree. A limited number of publications represent formal research effort. Surprisingly, there is no major initiative aimed at the systematic cultivation of Gomortega, which is an excellent candidate for domestication, especially for fruit production. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

	abstract = {Pollen is one of the primary causes of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis in urban centers. In the present study, the concentrations of 39 different pollens in the Santiago de Chile metropolitan area over the period 2009-2013 are characterized. The pollen was monitored daily using Burkard volumetric equipment. The contribution of each type of pollen and the corresponding time trends are evaluated. The concentrations of the pollens are compared with the established threshold levels for the protection of human health. The results show that the total amount of pollen grains originating from trees, grasses, weeds and indeterminate sources throughout the period of the study was 258,496 grains m-3, with an annual average of 51,699 ± 3,906 grains m-3 year-1. The primary source of pollen is Platanus orientalis, which produces 61.8% of the analyzed pollen. Grass pollen is the third primary component of the analyzed pollen, with a contribution of 5.82%. Among the weeds, the presence of Urticacea (3.74%) is remarkable. The pollination pattern of the trees is monophasic, and the grasses have a biphasic pattern. The trends indicate that the total pollen and tree pollen do not present a time trend that is statistically significant throughout the period of the study, whereas the grass pollen and weed pollen concentrations in the environment present a statistically significant decreasing trend. The cause of this decrease is unclear. The pollen load has doubled over the past decade. When the observed concentrations of the pollens were compared with the corresponding threshold levels, the results indicated that over the period of the study, the pollen concentrations were at moderate, high and very high levels for an average of 293 days per year. Systematic counts of the pollen grains are an essential method for diagnosing and treating patients with pollinosis and for developing forestation and urban planning strategies. © 2015 Toro A. et al.},

Results showed high abundances throughout the year (average of 4440 &#177;3153 ind./l) with seasonal changes and blooms in autumn (maximum 19108 ind./l), which were mainly associated with high concentrations of total nitrogen, nitrate, and ammonium. The morphology of C. furcoides showed changes in the total length and number of horns of the hypotheca, which were related to the environmental conditions and its abundance.

Here we evaluated the role of urban areas on avian diversity for a South American city, allowing us to examine the effects of urban features common worldwide, using the city of Valdivia, Chile as case study. We assessed the number of birds and their relative abundance in 152 grid cells of equal size (250 m2) distributed across the city. We estimated nine independent variables: land cover diversity (DC), building density (BD), impervious surface (IS), municipal green space (MG), non-municipal green space (NG), domestic garden space (DG), distance to the periphery (DP), social welfare index (SW), and vegetation diversity (RV). Impervious surface represent 41.8% of the study area, while municipal green, non-municipal green and domestic garden represent 11.6%, 23.6% and 16% of the non-man made surface. Exotic vegetation species represent 74.6% of the total species identified across the city. We found 32 bird species, all native with the exception of House Sparrow and Rock Pigeon. The most common species were House Sparrow and Chilean Swallow. Total bird richness responds negatively to IS and MG, while native bird richness responds positively to NG and negatively to BD, IS DG and, RV. Total abundance increase in areas with higher values of DC and BD, and decrease in areas of higher values of IS, SW and VR. Native bird abundance responds positively to NG and negatively to BD, IS MG, DG and RV. Our results suggest that not all the general patterns described in previous studies, conducted mainly in the USA, Europe, and Australia, can be applied to Latin American cities, having important implications for urban planning. Conservation efforts should focus on non-municipal areas, which harbor higher bird diversity, while municipal green areas need to be improved to include elements that can enhance habitat quality for birds and other species. These findings are relevant for urban planning in where both types of green space need to be considered, especially non-municipal green areas, which includes wetlands, today critically threatened by urban development. © 2015 Silva et al.},

	abstract = {Pinus pseudostrobus Lindl. is a widely distributed species in Mexico that also occurs in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador and has been tested outside its natural range in Brazil, Chile, Colombia, New Zealand, South Africa and Venezuela. Due to its great potential, it is necessary to select genotypes capable of increasing its production in the shortest possible time through genetic improvement strategies, where individuals are subjected to conditions forcing them to express their growth potential in advance. The objectives of the present study were to evaluate the genetic variation among half-sib progenies and to estimate heritability (h2) of stem height (SH) and diameter (SD) for seedlings grown under different competitive conditions in a common garden trial. A split-plot experimental design with four replications and three competitive environments (treatments) was used: (I) low inter-family competition (0.25 × 0.12 m), (II) high inter-family competition (0.12 × 0.06 m), and (III) high intra-family competition; 13 half-sib families were assessed, carrying out monthly evaluations for 10 months. Estimated h2 at individual and family-means levels for both SH and SD varied among competitive environments. For conditions I and II, a trend towards increasing h2 with age of seedlings was shown, but for condition III, a reverse trend was observed (values close to zero). High genetic stability in SH performance was found in both I and II, and II and III, pairs of environments, as measured by the type-B genetic correlation (0.70 ≤ rB ≤ 1.0), but it tended to decrease after 9 months, when competition increased; genetic stability in SD was lower (0.20 ≤ rB ≤ 0.80) in both pairs of the environments that were sampled. It was concluded that the competition conditions used in field trials for genotype evaluation may significantly affect the variance components, estimation of genetic parameters and genotype stability. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

	abstract = {Urban landscapes are commonly considered too mundane and corrupted to be biotically interesting. Recent insect surveys employing 29 Malaise traps throughout Los Angeles, California, however, have uncovered breeding populations of two unexpected species of one of the most studied and familiar groups of organisms, Drosophila "fruit " flies. Unlike most introduced species of drosophilids, which breed in fresh or decaying fruits, these are specialized flower-breeders. A common species in the survey was Drosophila (Drosophila) gentica Wheeler and Takada, previously collected only once, in El Salvador. It belongs to the flavopilosa species group, all species of which have been known until now from central Chile, Argentina and Uruguay, to Veracruz, Mexico and the Caribbean, breeding in flowers of Cestrum ("jessamine") and Sessea (Solanaceae). The Los Angeles populations are probably breeding in a native and/or introduced Cestrum; in addition, populations in San Luis Obispo County were visiting ornamental Cestrum. Drosophila gentica occurs as far north as San Francisco, where it was found breeding in Cestrum aurantiacum. D. gentica is redescribed and figured in detail for diagnostic and identification purposes. Specimens from Jamaica previously identified as D. gentica are a distinct species but are not formally described in lieu of complete male specimens. Rare in the Malaise traps was Drosophila (Sophophora) flavohirta Malloch, a common species in Australia on the blossoms of native Myrtaceae, found on introduced Eucalyptus in South Africa and both Eucalyptus and Syzygium in Madagascar; adults feed on myrtaceous pollen and nectar, larvae breed in the flowers. It is also redescribed in detail, including its unusual egg. This is the first New World report of this species; DNA sequences confirm it is a morphologically highly aberrant member of the D. melanogaster species group. This study reveals how intensive field sampling can uncover remarkable biodiversity in even the most urbanized areas. © 2015 Grimaldi et al.},

The following factors were analyzed: number of publications indexed in WoS and Scopus, citation frequency, impact indexes, h-Index, international contribution, self-citing and subject area of publications. The articles selected indicated affiliation either to faculties that offered undergraduate Forestry Programs in March 2012 or to public and private institutions associated with the forestry sector. Using this information, a ranking of scientific productivity for each institution was established according to the number of publications registered in WoS. Results show that the universities which offered Forestry Programs published 515 articles in WoS indexed journals and 625 in Scopus, corresponding to 88.5 and 85.0 % of the publications in the period, respectively. Universidad de Concepción, Universidad Austral de Chile and Universidad de Chile concentrate more than two-thirds of WoS and Scopus-indexed articles; the number of publications per researcher indicates that Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile and Universidad de Concepción are in first and second place followed by Universidad Austral de Chile and Universidad de Chile. Most publications (more than 80 %) are concentrated between the years 2006 and 2011.

	abstract = {The need for conservation outside protected areas has prompted the modifi cation of productive practices to allow the maintenance of wild biota in productive landscapes such as those associated to timber production. Forest plantations could cooperate in conserving biodiversity outside protected areas if they have a developed understory. However, the success of the production changes depends on the social support they receive. Therefore, we evaluate Chilean citizens' preference for five habitats of different types of forest management. In addition, we assessed perceptions regarding the relationship between pine plantations and native wildlife through surveys administered in Chillán, Santiago and six rural localities in the VII and VIII region. Despite there is not a unanimous opinion regarding pine plantations as a threat to biodiversity, people prefer pine plantations that serve as habitat for endangered fauna. In fact, they agree on paying more for forest products to contribute to conservation in forest plantations, and actually prefer plantations with a developed understory better than those without it. This would suggest that measures aimed at conservation in forest plantations could be supported by the Chilean society. © Sociedad de Biología de Chile.},

	abstract = {Mediterranean ecosystems are global hotspots of biodiversity threaten by human disturbances. Growing evidence indicates that regeneration of Mediterranean forests can be halted under certain circumstances and that successional stages can become notoriously persistent. The Mediterranean sclerophyllous forest in central Chile is been largely transformed into savannas dominated by the invasive legume tree Acacia caven as result of interacting management and ecological factors. We used multi-temporal satellite imagery to study the transition dynamics of these major vegetation types over the last four decades (1975-2008). Vegetation changes were related to indicators of resource availability (topography, water availability, solar radiance), potential propagule availability (distance to forest remnant patches) and disturbance regimes (grazing, fire occurrence and distance to roads and cities). During this study period, forests were mostly converted into Acacia savannas (46.1%). Acacia savanna was the most persistent natural vegetation type. The probability of sclerophyllous forest degradation into Acacia savanna increased on drier northern-exposed slopes, close to roads and further away from forest remnants. In contrast, forest regeneration from Acacia savanna was higher on moister southern-exposed slopes and closer to forest remnants. Acacia savannas are increasingly being converted into cultivated land on the moister locations or switching into a bare soil state in locations close to cities and further away from forest remnants. These results highlight the vulnerability of diverse sclerophyllous forests and its increasing conversion into persistent Acacia savannas in the Mediterranean region of central Chile and identify the ecological conditions for successful conservation and restoration of the native sclerophyllous forest vegetation that can be used for sensible land use planning. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

The mechanism of introduction for the majority of these non-indigenous species is unknown; however, horticultural development, urban and suburban transformation of original natural habitats, and the aquarium trade are the most likely pathways of introduction.

	abstract = {Biodiversity surveys for myxomycetes (Amoebozoa) were carried out in three consecutive years (2009 to 2011) in the cold arid Patagonian Steppe, Argentina. The surveys, the first to cover such an extensive area in South America, form part of the Myxotropic project funded by the Spanish Government. Specimens were collected in 174 localities in four different provinces (Neuquén, Río Negro, Chubut and Santa Cruz), between 36° and 52° S latitudes. The most common types of substrate investigated were the dominant shrubs and grasses of the Patagonian steppe, and the Nothofagus forests, characteristic of the transition areas, but other plants such as small cacti and cushion plants were also included in the survey. A total of 133 different species and 5 varieties of myxomycetes representing 31 genera were identified in the 1134 specimens collected either in the field, or from moist chamber cultures prepared with samples of plant material obtained from the same collecting sites. The results include one species new to science, Perichaena nigra, and 17 species and two varieties that were previously unknown for either the Neotropics or South America, Badhamia armillata, Dianema mongolicum, Didymium annulisporum, D. leptotrychum, D. orthonemata, D. sturgisii, Echinostelium coelocephalum, Licea deplanata, L. nannengae, Macbrideola argentea, M. oblonga, Oligonema aurantium, Perichaena luteola, P. madagascariensis, Physarum luteolum, Protophysarum phloiogenum, Trichia contorta var. attenuata, T. contorta var. iowensis, T. erecta. An additional 19 species are new records for Argentina. These additions make Argentina the country in South America, at present, with the greatest number of myxomycetes catalogued having more than 50% of the species cited from the whole Neotropics. Diversity and biogeographic distribution of these organisms are discussed, and taxonomic comments on rare or unusual species are included and illustrated with photographs by LM and SEM. The results indicate that the myxomycetes, are widely distributed and are a normal component of Patagonian biota. Many of the substrates investigated were endemic plants from the region and are new substrates for a number of species of myxomycete. Differences between the variety of species in this area and others in Argentina and Chile, suggest a certain regional specialization of these organisms, the assemblage of which appear to depend on plant substrate species.},

	abstract = {A wide diversity of organisms is dispersed on abiotic floating substrata, but little is known about the succession of fouling communities on these items. The main abiotic floating items found in the oceans (volcanic pumice, plastics, and Styrofoam) differ in 3 principal characteristics, namely surface rugosity, buoyancy, and floating behaviour, confirmed herein by light and electron microscopy (SEM), measurements of buoyancy, and laboratory tests to determine floating stability. In order to examine how these properties affect colonization and com munity succession on these substrata, 3 experiments were conducted in the field for 14 wk: (1) substrata were permanently submerged to determine if colonization depends on substratum surface ('Rings' experiment); (2) substrata were tethered at the sea surface to examine the importance of buoyancy ('Lines' experiment); and (3) substrata were caged to test the role of their floating behaviour ('Cages' experiment). The most common colo nizers in all 3 experiments were diatoms, Ulvales, and clonal ascidians from the genus Diplosoma. Surface rugosity of the substrata had only minor effects on the taxonomic richness of the developing communities. Buoyancy caused some differences in taxon cover, but taxon richness was similar on all 3 substrata. Finally, the floating behaviour at the sea surface had a strong influence on the communities developing on the floating substrata. Plastics (fewest changes in position) presented a higher richness and cover of taxa, while Styrofoam (most positional changes) harboured very few taxa. We conclude that colonization and succession on floating substrata is strongly influenced by positional changes, while surface rugosity and buoyancy appear important only during initial stages of community succession. © Inter-Research 2011.},

	abstract = {Facilitation (positive interactions) has emerged as a dominant ecological mechanism in many ecosystems. Its importance has recently been expanded to include intraspecific interactions, creating the potential for higher-level natural selection within species. Using multiple lines of evidence, we show that conspecific facilitation within the southern beech tree, Nothofagus pumilio, appears to overcome competition in two life phases. In a seedling experiment addressing stress and planting-density effects, we found that mortality was lowest (~0%) where there was no stress and was indistinguishable across densities. Furthermore, in mature forests (45 years old), genetically variable, merged individuals had lower mortality (- 50%) than un-merged individuals in locations without identifiable stress. Thus, a full understanding of the occurrence of facilitation may require a more general model of resource improvements than the commonly cited stress gradient hypothesis. Additionally, the merged trees showed a density-dependent mortality pattern at the level of the group. These data demonstrate a potential mechanism (facilitation) driving natural selection at this higher level, via stem merging. These merged "superorganisms" would confirm theoretical predictions whereby facilitation acts as an ecological mechanism driving group selection. © 2011 by The University of Chicago.},

	abstract = {Kelp beds, besides being one of the most important benthic resources in northern Chile, provide a variety of environmental goods and services. In order to evaluate economically the wild kelp populations in northern Chile (26° to 32° S) more than simply their commercial value as a source of raw materials for alginate extraction, we used several economic indicators to holistically assess the value of a group of brown seaweeds of economic importance, Lessonia spp. and Macrocystis pyrifera: (1) market value of biomass as a source of raw material for extraction of alginic acid, (2) market value of associated species of economic importance, (3) value as a source of scientific information, (4) value as a climate buffer (CO2 capture and release of O2), (5) value of associated biodiversity (non-commercial species), (6) value as cultural heritage and (7) value as a reservoir of biodiversity. Existence values of kelp beds which estimate the willingness of citizens to pay and work without payment to preserve the ecosystem were calculated using the contingent valuation technique. The results indicate that kelp beds in northern Chile have a total value of US $540 million. Of this total, kelp fishery accounts for 75 % and associated-species fisheries account for 15 %. In this context, the economic value of Chilean kelp beds is mainly associated with the industry of alginate extraction. By contrast, existence value as a source of scientific information or environmental buffer for CO2 capture or O2 production represents only 9 % of the total value, representing a very low relative importance to society. The economic valuation of coastal resources and marine ecosystems is a complementary tool for decision making and implementation of public policies related to the conservation and sustainable exploitation of renewable resources and their ecosystems. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

	abstract = {Using bird survey data taken in three cities in Southern Chile, we evaluated the hypothesis that changes in community composition from periurban to urban areas are not random. Furthermore, the consistency of species and guild loss was assessed across cities. A consistent pattern of difference in community and guild structure between urban and periurban habitats was found. In addition, a nonrandom loss of species was found in urban areas compared to periurban areas, and non-native species dominated urban communities in all cities. The average abundance of omnivores, granivores, and habitat generalists was higher in urban areas, while insectivores and open habitat species were more abundant in periurban areas. These results strongly suggest that urban habitats act as filters offering suitable conditions for only a fraction of the bird species present in a given area, and the lack of suitable conditions may be facilitating local biotic homogenization in the three studied cities. The results of this study not only fill a biogeographical knowledge gap, but the work presented here also aids the general understanding of factors that affect community structure in habitats with varied levels of local and global urbanization. © 2016 Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {The dynamics of Enochrus variegatus (Steinheil) and Enochrus vulgaris (Steinheil) in temporary pools and permanent ponds were studied in an urban park of Buenos Aires, Argentina. Samples were collected from both types of habitats weekly throughout one year, and variables like water surface and vegetation cover were recorded. In permanent ponds, adults of both species were found throughout the study period, while in temporary pools their presence depended on the availability of water. Differences in their reproductive seasons and breeding sites were observed. Enochrus vulgaris was characterized by an opportunistic strategy, and its larvae were detected in both types of habitats, associated mainly with spring and summer temperatures. Conversely, E. variegatus larvae were recorded almost exclusively in temporary pools, during the winter and spring seasons. In permanent ponds, both species were associated with vegetation cover, which could be related to the availability of refuges from fi sh predators. First instar larvae showed the highest abundance and were captured more frequently, in consecutive weeks and simultaneously with third instar larvae, suggesting that the two populations studied are not synchronized in oviposition time or development of immature stages. In several occasions, second instar larvae of both species were captured in a pool that had been dry during the previous sampling date, suggesting that they had not hatched from fresh laid eggs. Our fi ndings show that adults of these species are capable of dispersal to and from temporary pools to avoid drought. In addition, their larval stages may also be able to resist drought in the pools by burrowing into the substrate. © Sociedad de Biología de Chile.},

	abstract = {Biodiversity loss caused by population growth, the demand of resources and productive activities is inconsistent with the recognition of its importance. In terrestrial ecosystems, the National State System of Protected Areas (SNASPE) contains about 19 % of continental Chile. Although it does not represent all the ecosystems with endangered species, it can be supplemented by implementing new public and private protected areas (PA and PPP, respectively). The development of Marine Protected Areas (AMP) is emerging, and some strategies share conservation responsibility with local stakeholders. In Chile, a set of regulations, laws and international treaties promote different conservation opportunities in land and marine coastal ecosystems. Some of the derived challenges involve standardizing the classifi cation of species in conservation categories according to an international Protocol and optimizing the methodologies for selecting priority conservation areas; both criteria are essential for decision-making in biodiversity conservation. Another challenge is integrating the intrinsic value of biodiversity and the ecosystem services provided for promoting a participatory culture. This would improve the effectiveness of different strategies for the protection and sustainable use of biodiversity, involving education and citizen participation from a bio-cultural perspective. Education promotes nature conservation, as people become aware of their environment. Since participation involves citizens as actors in decision-making, it promotes the effective implementation of strategies for the conservation of biodiversity. © Sociedad de Biología de Chile.},

Ten percent of the animals were seropositive to one or more serovars. Seroprevalence was significantly higher in ungulates (20.4%) compared to carnivores (3.8%) and primates (3.4%). There were no significant differences in seroprevalence among sex and age ranges. The most frequent serovar detected was Autumnalis, present in 53.4% of antibody-positive animals. Most positive animals had titers of ≤1:200, except for a maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus) with titers of 1:400 against serovar Hardjo. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of Leptospira exposure detected in native endangered pudu (Pudu puda) and the first confirmation of exposure to L. interrogans in captive wild mammals in Chile.

	abstract = {Urban trees contribute to environment through their biological and amenity functions, and are an economic and social value for cities, as well as a sustainability value. However, their value in monetary terms is difficult to quantify, it is given mainly by formulas, being a practice adopted in several cities. The objective of this study was to compare seven formulas used in ten municipalities of Chile (seven communes of the great Santiago: La Florida, La Pintana, Maipú, Ñuñoa, Peñalolén, Renca and Vitacura; and three cities: Antofagasta, Concepción and Talca), besides the formula of Council of Tree Landscape Appraiser (CTLA) USA. The formulas were applied to two trees of 14 species selected in different urban contexts in Talca, determining the differences and similarities of the monetary results of the appraisal. For the statistical analysis the Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric variance test and the Fisher's least significant difference (LSD) test were used. The results show a wide dispersion of monetary values obtained by formula and per specie, with statistically significant differences in both cases. Only the formula of the municipalities Concepción, La Pintana and Maipú (COPIMA) has a similar performance to that of CTLA regarding the dispersion of the values obtained. The results are consistent with international studies that suggest the use of formulas to assess the urban trees, especially when including variables such as location, condition and amenities of the tree, as compared to those formulas of capitalization or those that are oriented only to assess damage. For Chile, the best formula recommended was that of COPIMA.},

Particularly, intense propagule pressure by alien plant species can pose a threat to native biodiversity. However, little is known about the factors that determine invasibility and the role of roads and other human disturbances for such small protected areas. Within a peri-urban reserve close to the city of Concepción, south-central Chile, we investigated the influence of different site and landscape characteristics on the richness of native and alien plant species across different habitat (ruderal, road and forest sites) and forest types (native and alien dominated forests). Compared to other protected areas, alien species were frequently found in this reserve indicating the importance of urban areas as source for alien species. Aliens concentrate around disturbed ruderal and road sites, facilitating their spread into the reserve. Natural forest areas are less invaded until now. Within forests alien plant species richness was, however, positively associated to the proximity to disturbed landscapes. Forests dominated by alien tree species within the reserve are not the source for alien species within natural forests, but they negatively affect native species richness by replacing adequate seed sources. In order to prevent a further spread of alien species into peri-urban reserves, large scale anthropogenic disturbances should be minimized, already invaded sites must be monitored and buffer-zones protecting reserves from surrounding land use activities should be established. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

	abstract = {Questions: Which are the factors that influence forest and shrubland loss and regeneration and their underlying drivers? Location: Central Chile, a world biodiversity hotspot. Methods: Using land-cover data from the years 1975, 1985, 1999 and 2008, we fitted classification trees and multiple logistic regression models to account for the relationship between different trajectories of vegetation change and a range of biophysical and socio-economic factors. Results: The variables that most consistently showed significant effects on vegetation change across all time-intervals were slope and distance to primary roads. We found that forest and shrubland loss on one side and regeneration on the other often displayed opposite patterns in relation to the different explanatory variables. Deforestation was positively related to distance to primary roads and to distance within forest edges and was favoured by a low insolation and a low slope. In turn, forest regeneration was negatively related to the distance to primary roads and positively to the distance to the nearest forest patch, insolation and slope. Shrubland loss was positively influenced by slope and distance to cities and primary roads and negatively influenced by distance to rivers. Conversely, shrubland regeneration was negatively related to slope, distance to cities and distance to primary roads and positively related to distance from existing forest patches and distance to rivers. Conclusions: This article reveals how biophysical and socioeconomic factors influence vegetation cover change and the underlying social, political and economical drivers. This assessment provides a basis for management decisions, considering the crucial role of perennial vegetation cover for sustaining biodiversity and ecosystem services. © 2011 International Association for Vegetation Science.},

	abstract = {Summary: Phylogenetic conservatism of tolerance to freezing temperatures has been cited to explain the tendency of plant lineages to grow in similar climates. However, there is little information about whether or not freezing resistance is conserved across phylogenies, and whether conservatism of physiological traits could explain conservatism of realized climatic niches. Here, we compared the phylogenetical lability of realized climatic niche, foliar freezing resistance and four morphological leaf traits that are generally considered to be adaptations to frost resistance in the Chilean species of Myrceugenia, which grows in a wide range of habitats. We estimated the predicted niche occupancy profiles with respect to minimum temperature (minT) of all species. We measured foliar freezing resistance (using chlorophyll fluorescence), leaf size, leaf mass per area (LMA), stomatal and trichome densities of 10 individuals per species. Finally, we estimated phylogenetic signal, and we performed independent contrast analyses among all variables. We found that both foliar freezing resistance and minT were subject to a significant phylogenetic signal, but the former had a stronger signal. We also detected a significant, but weak correlation between them (r = 0.49, Pone tail = 0.04). Morphological traits evolved independent of any phylogenetic effect. Synthesis. Our results show that freezing resistance evolved in association with temperature niche, but with some delay that could result from phylogenetic inertia. Our results also show that morphological leaf traits are more labile than realized climatic niche and frost tolerance and that the formers probably evolved in association with microhabitat preferences.

A few wetland areas have been well studied, whereas little is known about others, including some that are very large. Despite the fact that most South American countries have signed the Ramsar convention, efforts to elaborate basic data have been insufficient, thereby hindering the formulation of a wetland-friendly policy allowing the sustainable management of these areas. Until now, the low population density in many wetland areas has provided a high level of protection; however, the pressure on wetland integrity is increasing, mainly as a result of land reclamation for agriculture and animal ranching, infrastructure building, pollution, mining activities, and the construction of hydroelectric power plants. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has predicted increasing temperatures, accelerated melting of the glaciers in Patagonia and the Andes, a rise in sea level of 20-60 cm, and an increase in extreme multiannual and short-term climate events (El Niño and La Niña, heavy rains and droughts, heat waves). Precipitation may decrease slightly near the Caribbean coast as well as over large parts of Brazil, Chile, and Patagonia, but increase in Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru, around the equator, and in southeastern South America. Of even greater impact may be a change in rainfall distribution, with precipitation increasing during the rainy season and decreasing during the dry season. There is no doubt that the predicted changes in global climate will strongly affect South American wetlands, mainly those with a low hydrologic buffer capacity. However, for the coming decades, wetland destruction by wetland-unfriendly development planning will by far outweigh the negative impacts of global climate change. South American governments must bear in mind that there are many benefits that wetlands bring about for the landscape and biodiversity as well as for humans. While water availability will be the key problem for the continent's cities and agroindustries, intact wetlands can play a major role in storing water, buffering river and stream discharges, and recharging subterranean aquifers. © 2012 Springer Basel AG.},

A neotype is designated for E. caesia Wulp, and the following lectotype designations have also been made to better stabilize nomenclature (here cited in their original combination): Ephydra chilensis Mac-quart, Ephydra densepilosa Hendel, Ephydra pravoneura Hendel, Ephydra prionoptera Thomson, and Dimecoenia zurcheri Hendel. Dimecoenia venteli Oliveira is listed as a species inquirenda, as the type series includes only female spec-imens that we cannot presently recognize. Although the genera and subgenera are fairly easily distinguished, the included species are frequently difficult to separate, and we have generally relied on characters of the male terminalia to determine a species identity. Illustrations of male terminalia and distribution maps are included for each species and keys to all taxa have been provided. © 2016 Magnolia Press.},

	abstract = {Background: The New Zealand mud snail Potamopyrgus antipodarum (Gray, 1843) is among the most widespread non-indigenous mollusk in the world. Based on a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis, the invasion of this species to central Chile, which is also the first record of this species from South America, is reported. Results: Molecular analysis identified four populations of P. antipodarum in central Chile, Parque O'Higgins and Estero La Dehesa in Santiago city, and Estero Consuelo and the Chalinga River in Salamanca, a town located in a different basin. No sequence divergence was found among populations in the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene. Morphological and reproductive evidence is in agreement with these findings. Conclusions: This is the first record of P. antipodarum in the Neotropical region. All populations contained only females with embryos or juvenile snails in their brood pouches suggesting that they are viable and well established. It is important to prevent the spread of P. antipodarum to other localities in Chile and other South American countries. © 2014 Collado; licensee Springer.},

This study presents field observations of species associations sampled from shallow wetlands located in the urban zones of Valdivia (39°S) and Puerto Montt (41°S). A species presence-absence matrix was created for calculating the Jaccard Index of community similarity and for testing null models of species associations, with the aim of determining whether species associations are random or not. The results of the Jaccard Index calculations indicated the existence of non-defined groups. The results of the null model analysis denoted the presence of regulating factors for Valdivia wetlands, whereas for Puerto Montt wetlands no such factors could be demonstrated. The outcomes of both the Jaccard Index and the significant null model analysis agree with previous ecological descriptions of changes in trophic status as a consequence of changes in the surrounding basin as a determinant of species associations.

	abstract = {A series of pests have been detected in plantations and urban trees, affecting directly the economy and recreational areas. The elm leaf beetle, Xanthogaleruca luteola Müller (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), is an insect pest that skeletonises the leaves of Ulmus spp., trees with a great ornamental value, which can become completely defoliated. The boldo tree (Peumus boldus Molina) is an evergreen plant endemic in Chile that contains secondary metabolites. Proximal analysis and insecticidal effects of extracts obtained from young and mature leaves with water and ethanol from P. boldus were evaluated at various concentrations on X. luteola under laboratory conditions in a completely randomized experiment considering two leaf maturity stages and solvents. Dry weight, water content, ash, and crude fiber leaf flour were significantly different between maturity stages, but the percentage of lipids and proteins were similar. Also, the 50% lethal concentration (LC 50) was determined for each extract. The extracts obtained with both solvents were effective in controlling X. luteola adults in the laboratory, reaching over 50% average mortality at concentrations greater than 3.6% (w/v) in the young leaf extract and 4.0% (w/v) in the mature leaf extract. The lowest LC 50 was 1.2% (w/v), obtained from the young leaf extract with ethanol after 48 h. This bioinsecticide from the leaves of P. boldus suggests an interesting opportunity for use in integrated pest management of X. luteola.},

	abstract = {The interaction between plant attributes, environmental factors and the history of human intervention determines which species show a more invasive behavior and which areas are more likely to be invaded. Identifying which factors favor the invasion and which constraint it, remains an essential goal for understanding the process of invasion and to provide a stronger scientific basis for designing management actions to reduce susceptibility to invasion. In this paper we analyze the relative role of different environmental factors in plant invasion, in particular the comparison between human versus climatic and biotic variables at different spatial scales. Furthermore, we show how these factors interact to influence the distribution and abundance of an invasive plant. We have built mixed models to explain the presence and abundance of a renowned invasive species in the south-central area of Chile, Teline monspessulana (French broom, Fabaceae). We recorded the presence and cover of this invasive shrub in a series of transects along the main roads of the study area. For each transect we recorded variables at different spatial scales related to climate and land use. We found that the presence and cover of T. monspessulana are strongly related to proximity to roads, urban areas and locations with higher rainfall. Although this shrub is present in most of the landscape, it is most abundant in shrublands and forest plantations. In a complex human-dominated landscape matrix, shrublands and forest plantations act as a source of propagules from which new areas can be invaded. Interestingly, the presence of this species can be better predicted by combining predictors taken at two hierarchical levels, the so-called transect and plot scales, whereas the species abundance only depends on factors at the plot level. The presence and abundance of this species is highly dependent on human disturbance, and the occurrence of certain landscape elements closely linked to land management is critical to the performance of this species. Maintaining a dense tree canopy cover and reducing the use of fire could help reduce the rate of expansion of this species across the landscape. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

	abstract = {Alstroemeria L., one of the most diverse genera of the Chilean flora and of high floricultural value, is represented by 35 species, most of them distributed between 28-38° S in the Mediterranean zone of Central Chile. There are 24 complexforming taxa, of which 18 have conservation problems. One of these complexes is Alstroemeria diluta E. Bayer. with two subspecies: subsp. diluta and subsp. chrysantha Bayer. Alstroemeria diluta grows only in Chile; subsp. diluta is distributed from 34º15’S, Region of O’Higgins, to Cauquenes (36º00’S), Region of Maule, and subsp. chrysantha from 28º08’S, Region of Atacama, to Punta Curaumilla (33º05’S), Region of Valparaíso. A comparative karyotype study was carried out among four populations of A. diluta subsp. diluta and three populations of A. diluta subsp. chrysantha. The seven populations presented an asymmetric karyotype, with 2n = 2x = 16 chromosomes, and with same karyotype formulae: 3m + 1sm + 1st + 3 t. The architecture of the karyotype between the subspecies is the same. The scatter plot among MCA vs. CVCL shows different groupings between populations of the two subspecies, and the total chromosomes length (LTC) is highest in the populations of subsp. chrysantha. According to the results obtained, the populations growing in Valparaíso Region should be considered belong to subsp. diluta. © 2017, Universidad de Concepcion. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Although domestic dogs play many important roles in rural households, they can also be an important threat to the conservation of wild vertebrates due to predation, competition and transmission of infectious diseases. An increasing number of studies have addressed the impact of dogs on wildlife but have tended to ignore the motivations and attitudes of the humans who keep these dogs and how the function of dogs might influence dog-wildlife interactions. To determine whether the function of domestic dogs in rural communities influences their interactions with wildlife, we conducted surveys in rural areas surrounding protected lands in the Valdivian Temperate Forests of Chile. Sixty percent of farm animal owners reported the use of dogs as one of the primary means of protecting livestock from predators. The probability of dog-wild carnivore interactions was significantly associated with the raising of poultry. In contrast, dog-wild prey interactions were not associated with livestock presence but had a significant association with poor quality diet as observed in previous studies. Dog owners reported that they actively encouraged the dogs to chase off predators, accounting for 25-75% of the dog-wild carnivore interactions observed, depending on the predator species. Humans controlled the dog population by killing pups and unwanted individuals resulting in few additions to the dog population through breeding; the importation of predominantly male dogs from urban areas resulted in a sex ratios highly dominated by males. These results indicate that dog interactions with wildlife are related to the role of the dog in the household and are directly influenced by their owners. To avoid conflict with local communities in conservation areas, it is important to develop strategies for managing dogs that balance conservation needs with the roles that dogs play in these rural households. © 2014 Sepúlveda et al.},

Using biochemical, sequencing techniques six different isolates were studied and two bacterial species were identified, corresponding to Streptococcus phocae and Aliivibrio sp. Challenge tests by intraperitoneal injection showed that a representative S. phocae isolate 151 is pathogenic for Atlantic salmon. No mortalities or morphological alterations were observed in fish injected with Aliivibrio sp. (isolate 222). Infections of Atlantic salmon with S. phocae have been restricted to temperatures higher than 15SC; however our data represent the first report of S. phocae associated with mortality of salmonids farmed in cold water (5°C). Additional studies are necessary to evaluate the risk for salmonid cultured below 10°C, particularly because the prevalence of infections by S. phocae could be underrated due to their possible confusion with other bacterial infections.},

	abstract = {The main objective of this research was to test Chilean native plants under green roof conditions using an appropriate substrate of local origin. Sixteen native species from the Mediterranean region of the country were chosen and grouped into four landscape groups (three adapted to full sun and one to partial shade) and planted under green roof simulation inside the urban area of Santiago. Two different substrate mixes and 9 cm of depth were used to grow the four landscape groups. As a control, replicates of each association were grown under garden situation in the same location and without soil depth limitations. The parameters analyzed were percentage of survival, aerial growth, rate of coverage, time of flowering, competitiveness ability against weeds as well as maintenance cost and quantity of water required. During the first growing season was possible to observe that weed pressure was 8 times less than in the garden controls. In the full sun association Glandularia berteri has performed exceptionally presenting frost resistance and early and extended blooming. Also in that association Geum magellanicum performed above the average. In the partial shade association Cotula scariosa has shown a fast growth and frost resistance and the larger coverage rate. In general, the four plant groups shown to be suitable to be grown under green roof conditions with the exception of Plumbago coerulea that was not frost resistant. Future evaluations will be performed at least for another two growing seasons.},

	abstract = {A PCR-based method was developed to identify Naupactus cervinus (Boheman) and Naupactus xanthographus (Germar), two curculionids affecting the citrus industry in Chile. The quarantine status of these two species depends on the country to which fruits are exported. This identification method was developed because it is not possible to discriminate between these two species at the egg stage. The method is based on the species-specific amplification of sequences of internal transcribed spacers, for which we cloned and sequenced these genome fragments from each species. We designed an identification system based on two duplex-PCR reactions. Each one contains the species-specific primer set and a second generic primer set that amplify a short 18S region common to coleopterans, to avoid false negatives. The marker system is able to differentiate each Naupactus species at any life stage, and with a diagnostic sensitivity to 0.045 ng of genomic DNA. This PCR kit was validated by samples collected from different citrus production areas throughout Chile and showed 100% accuracy in differentiating the two Naupactus species. © The Authors 2015.

	abstract = {Timber plantation expansion is a significant form of landscape change with reported negative environmental and social impacts. We analyze the proximate drivers of plantation expansion in southcentral Chile, one of the countries in South America with the highest rates of afforestation and reforestation in the last decades. Satellite images from 1975, 1990 and 2007 were used to estimate autologistic regressions for the periods 1975-1990 and 1990-2007. Timber plantations (mostly Pinus radiata) increased from 29,213. ha in 1975 (5.5% of the landscape) to 224,716. ha in 2007 (42.4% of the landscape). We found a clearer pattern of expansion between 1975 and 1990 as compared to 1990-2007, associated with soils of forest suitability, steep slopes, and proximity to main cities, corporate landholding, and large farms. Between 1990 and 2007 some of these drivers lost significance as plantations expanded in all directions and became the predominant land cover. Additionally, 41.5% of new plantations in the 1975-1990 period and 22.8% in the 1990-2007 period were established by clearing secondary native forests, which corroborates that plantation expansion in Chile has been a direct cause of deforestation and biodiversity loss. Understanding the proximate drivers of plantation expansion is essential in order to advance our comprehension of the underlying patterns and causes of this landscape change, which will allow us to better predict which areas are more vulnerable to change, and help to prevent adverse environmental and social impacts as plantations expand to the southern regions of the country. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

This survey compared international formulae: Council of Tree Landscape Appraiser (CTLA), Burnley, Helliwell and Standard Tree Evaluation Method (STEM) and three Chilean methods applied in municipalities of Concepción, La Pintana, Maipú (COPIMA), Ñuñoa and Peñalolén, in 14 different trees located in Talca city (Chile). The objective was to identify the differences and similarities of the monetary result in the application of these formulae, which was realized by a professional. These were analyzed using a non parametric variance test of Kruskal - Wallis and the multiple comparisons Duncan test. It was possible to determine that the Chilean formulae did not present statistically signifcant differences with the international formulae of Burnley and CTLA; whereas Peñalolén and COPIMA formulae did not present any difference when contrasted with Helliwell. In addition, the STEM formula presented differences with all the Chilean analyzed formulae. In the valuation by tree, statistically signifcant differences were obtained, which showed the independence of the used formula. The exception was when being applied to emblematic species or to species that stand-out in some amenity. Likewise, it was observed that the basic value continues having a high impact in the appraisal fnal result and the use of the statistical test applied allows extending this type of analyses.},

The objectives of the study are twofold: to report successes in natural resources management at a local level as paradoxes of globalisation and to publicise how cultivated front and backyards contribute to build more sustainable urban agglomerations, benefitting both the society and the environment, because traditional healing practices and ethno-botanical knowledge are important legacies for future generations. The sources of data were a sample of one thousand, two hundred and fifty-four inquiries, 70% of which were urban gardeners and periurban farmers. Qualitative research included video records of particular interviewed traditional healers and urban gardeners, sometimes together with their flourishing plots. The investigated plant species have been photographed so as to permit easier dissemination of results to the scientific community and to the general public. Results have confirmed that native species and ancient indigenous prescriptions dominate, with the exceptions of Cuba and Argentina where native ethnic groups have been eradicated, and Uruguay, where the European influence was stronger. Gardening and periurban farming are beneficial for the social, cultural, economic and environmental sustainability of cities and metropolitan regions. © 2013 WIT Press.},

	abstract = {Freshwater systems are one of the environments most impacted by human activity, with pollution being a highly important factor. In Chile, several rivers exhibit varied levels of pollution, one of which is the Maipo River basin where the city of Santiago is located. The silverside Basilichthys microlepidotus (Jenyns) is an endemic fish species that inhabits this basin, thus we hypothesized that pollution has affected gene diversity and migration in populations of B. microlepidotus from the Maipo River basin. The aim of this study was to identify the population structure of B. microlepidotus in this basin and to determine if the populations of the silverside inhabiting polluted sites present differences in gene diversity and gene flow compared to populations inhabiting non-polluted areas. Using the variability of eight microsatellites, five populations of silverside were detected; three inhabiting non-polluted sites and two inhabiting polluted sites. From this, it was inferred that B. microlepidotus has been able to tolerate pollution in the Maipo River basin. No differences in gene diversity or migration were detected between polluted and non-polluted sites but comparison with historical estimation revealed an increase in the current migration rate when all the data from the basin were compared. A reduction in current effective population size was also observed when compared to historical values, and this is probably due to river degradation. Despite the disappearance of other fish species recorded at this basin, our results suggest that B. microepidotus is tolerant to pollution, thus indicating that native species respond differently to this environmental factor. © 2014, The Society of Population Ecology and Springer Japan.},

The Historic District, located in the downtown area of the city, showed the highest metal concentration of all the sampled sites, as well as the highest levels of the four biomarkers.

	abstract = {Several studies reveal that the richness of fauna declines with urbanization- being able to live into urban areas, such as birds, mammals, and herpetofauna. This research aims to be the fi rst one in estimating indirectly the potential urban fauna richness in Santiago. In order to achieve this, a multicriteria analysis was conducted based on fi ve factors (human disturbance, energy present in the system, heterogeneity of land uses, complexity of land uses, and natural areas), which contribute to the fauna richness along with their respective relative weights. Thus, a potential fauna richness index (PFRI) was generated, whose mapping allowed the identifi cation of favorable areas for the fauna richness (FAFR). In addition, the effect of a gradient of urbanization on FAFR was evaluated, the connectivity between FAFR was generated, and also the PFRI over the green areas, which belong to the urban area, was analyzed. As a result, in the urban area, the highest PFRI was displayed in the municipalities of Lampa, Lo Barnechea, Vitacura, and Peñalolén, followed by San Bernardo, Puente Alto, Pudahuel, Las Condes y Quilicura. Connectivity between FAFR was located north-east of Santiago city and near the Andes. Public green areas showed a surface and a PFRI with low value, in contrast to private green areas, located north-east with the higher values. Additionally, there is no perceivable effecton the PFRI due to the gradient of urbanization. Perhaps it is because, near to the limit of the urban area, there are highly densifi ed natural patches. Consequently, the urban areas in Santiago would not help increasing the fauna richness, being the most affected species those that inhabit in the ground. Finally, at the moment of evaluation of the fauna richness, not only a landscape study should be conducted, but also the local habitat characteristics should be incorporated, among which highlights the surface of the green areas. Also it is necessary to carry out an urban landscape planning, which leads to the connectivity between natural patches and green areas. This planning would allow the entry of fauna that circulates around urban areas, and thus would contribute to the improvement of biodiversity. © Sociedad de Biologia de Chile.},

Ninety-one physically healthy kelp gulls (Larus dominicanus) were sampled in the city of Talcahuano, Chile, during winter (July-September) of 2007, autumn (April-June) and winter of 2008, and autumn of 2009. After blood sampling, the kelp gulls were euthanized by cervical dislocation. Packed cell volume (PCV), hemoglobin, total plasma protein (TPP), and complete blood count were performed. Alanine amino transferase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, lactate dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), creatinine, urea, calcium, phosphorus, and uric acid were analyzed. No significant differences were found between sexes (P > 0.05). When a comparison was made between the two seasons, the values of PCV, TPP, white blood cell, heterophils, eosinophils, and monocytes were significantly higher in winter than in autumn (P < 0.05) while and urea and uric acid concentrations were higher in autumn. Heterophils were the predominant circulating leukocyte for all birds. There was no significant difference in body condition between autumn and winter nor between sexes. Body condition showed a significant relationship with TPP and basophil concentration and ALP activity. © 2015 by American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.},

	abstract = {Fleas and ticks frequently parasitise canines worldwide and their prevalence in dogs is influenced by many factors including climate and geography, among others. Different studies worldwide have shown no clear pattern of an urban or rural preference by different species of fleas and ticks infesting dogs. The aim of this study is to identify species of fleas and ticks present in urban and rural dogs from different ecoregions of Chile. A cross-sectional study was conducted in four urban-rural paired sites at four districts: Arica y Parinacota, Coquimbo, Metropolitana and Araucanía. A random and a convenience sampling of households in the urban and rural areas was carried out, collecting fleas and ticks from 112-114 dogs per locality. The frequency of fleas and ticks infestation between urban and rural areas was compared through Chi-square or Fisher's tests. A total of 921 dogs were examined, identifying four species of fleas (Ctenocephalides canis, Ctenocephalides felis, Pulex irritans and Echidnophaga gallinacea) and three species of ticks (Rhipicephalus sanguineus, Amblyomma tigrinum and Amblyomma triste). In general, a higher prevalence of dogs with fleas were observed in rural areas, being C. canis the most frequent species globally; there were significant variations in the distribution of different species according to district. R. sanguineus was the predominant tick in all the studied areas. Amblyomma species were found exclusively in rural areas; A. triste only in Arica y Parinacota and A. tigrinum in rural areas of Coquimbo and Araucanía districts.},

	abstract = {The five known genera of Gilliesieae have their diversity center in the Mediterranean zone of central Chile, where many of their habitats are threatened by urban expansion, industrial and agroforestry activities, as well as other anthropogenic impacts. Very little is known about the biology of these particular geophytes, the majority of which currently have either vulnerable or endangered status, mainly due to their dispersed and small populations generally associated to remnants of native vegetation. As mycorrhizal associations are essential for soil resource acquisition and stress mitigation in most plants, our objective was to assess the hitherto unknown mycotrophic status of ten species of Gilliesieae from central Chile by qualitative and quantitative assessment of intraradical fungal structures. All sampled genera (Gethyum, Gilliesia, Miersia, Solaria, Speea) showed regular presence of arbuscular mycorrhiza, while other mycorrhizal or putatively mutualistic associations, like dark septate endophytes, were practically absent. Mycorrhizal colonization of fi ne roots reached a mean of ca. 45 % across all examined taxa, with highly variable values ranging from 9 % to 82 % in Miersia tenuiseta and Gilliesia curicana, respectively. The high level of mycorrhization indicates that arbuscular mycorrhiza should be considered for conservation strategies of threatened species or biotechnological use in plant propagation. The main future task is the identifi cation of the associated fungal taxa. © Sociedad de Biología de Chile.},

	abstract = {Variation in climactic vegetation with altitude is widely used as an ecological indicator to identify bioclimatic belts. Tierra del Fuego is known to undergo structural and functional changes in forests along altitudinal gradients. However there is still little knowledge of the changes in plant-community composition and plant diversity –including both forests and tundra and their area of contact (krummholz)– and their relation to climatic factors along an altitudinal gradient. This study focuses on Isla Navarino (Chile), at the eastern part of Beagle Channel, included in the Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve. Numerical analysis revealed four community types along the cited gradient: a) mixed forest of Nothofagus betuloides and Nothofagus pumilio distributed at lower altitudes (0-300 masl); b) pure forests of Nothofagus pumilio distributed at higher altitudes (350-550 masl); c) krummholz forest of Nothofagus pumilio near the tree line (500-550 masl); and d) pulvinate-cushion vegetation –tundra– of Bolax gummifera and Abrotanella emarginata at altitudes above 600 masl. Species turnover showed that the most abrupt change in plant composition occurs from 550 to 600 masl, producing a drastic landscape change when the high-altitude tree limit formed by dwarf forest of deciduous N. pumilio yields to tundra at a calculated biotemperature of 2.9 ºC. Two other minor changes occur in the understory of pure Nothofagus pumilio forests: a transition from a thermophilous element to a more orophilous element at a calculated biotemperature of 4.3 ºC, and a drop in the number of species as the erect forest changes to low krummholz forest at a calculated biotemperature of 3.3 ºC. The identification of bioclimatic belts based on changes in vegetation and the calculation of biotemperature along the altitudinal gradient suggests that the following plant communities are reliable regional bioclimatic bioindicators: lowermiddle- oroantiboreal mixed forest of Nothofagus betuloides-Nothofagus pumilio; oroantiboreal pure forest of Nothofagus pumilio; hemi oroantarctic krummholz of Nothofagus pumilio; and oroantartic tundra of Bolax gummifera and Abrotanella emarginata. © 2017, Universidad de Concepcion.

	abstract = {Background and aims – Planothidium haynaldii (Schaarschm.) Lange-Bert. (≡Achnanthes haynaldii Schaarschm.) is a widely reported species from temperate and cold zones of southern and northern hemispheres despite being originally described from a high altitude stratovolcano (Antisana, 4100 m a.s.l.) in Ecuador (tropical climatic zone). Although widely cited in the literature, studies concerning the original material were never carried out. The main objective of this paper is to clarify the identity of Planothidium haynaldii and two related species from North-western USA and Antarctic environments.; Methods – The original type slide of Achnanthes haynaldii Schaarschm. was observed. Additionally, selected samples containing populations currently identified either as Planothidium haynaldii or Achnanthes lanceolata var. capitata O.Müll. collected in Oregon (USA) and James Ross Island (Antarctica) were observed. The samples were analyzed using light (LM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).; Key results – A new species, commonly improperly identified as Planothidium haynaldii, is described as Planothidium amphibium C.E.Wetzel, Ector & L.Pfister sp. nov. from aerial and aquatic habitats of Oregon (USA). This species is widely distributed in the northern hemisphere according to illustrated literature records. Achnanthes lanceolata var. capitata is erected to species level and transferred to the genus Planothidium. Planothidium capitatum (O.Müll.) Van de Vijver, Kopalová, C.E.Wetzel & Ector comb. & stat. nov. seems to be an important component of the communities in the Antarctic region where large populations were found on James Ross Island and Livingston Island living in the epilithon and epipelon of large lakes. Finally, Planothidium haynaldii seems to be rarer than initially expected and its occurrence is confirmed only in the Andes mountain range in South America (recent freshwater sample from Ecuador and as fossil in Chile). © 2014 Botanic Garden Meise and Royal Botanical Society of Belgium},

	abstract = {Biomass is regarded as an important indicator of ecological and management processes in urban vegetation, difficult to measure but easy to interpret. Existence and growing rates of biomass can be used to calculate carbon storage and sequestration, estimate dry deposition of air pollution or volatile organic compound emissions. In cities, management practices also affect the amount and distribution of biomass components within a tree and local calibrated equations should be used. However, traditional destructive methods to gather the data necessary to build such equations are less practical in urban environments. The main objective of this work was to develop above ground biomass and leaf area models by using non destructive methods for common urban trees in Santiago, Chile. We used randomised branch sampling (RBS), a non-destructive method, and easily measured variables such as DBH and total height to estimate crown biomass and leaf area for the 11 most common urban tree species in Santiago. Results using equations developed in this study yielded crown biomass estimates, comparable and within the range of values reported in literature and within those obtained from urban forest structure models. Leaf area results yielded more reasonable estimates when compared to field data and urban forest structure models. These equations can be incorporated into urban forest function models for more precise estimates of Latin American temperate urban forest function. With increased sampling intensity the RBS sampling method could be presented as a non-destructive and repeatable method for estimating different types of urban tree crown characteristics.},

Foliage was placed in a chamber with 20°C and 50% relative humidity. The water consumption and postharvest number of days were measured. Blechnum cordatum and B. magellanicum showed the longest vase life in citric acid pH 3 (7.4 and 10.2 days respectively) and also the highest water uptake. In E. giganteum, the longest vase life (8.8 days) and highest water uptake (170 ml) were observed in the control treatment. The results showed that citric acid helps to maintain the water uptake for longer time, which allowed B. cordatum and B. magellanicum foliage to stay hydrated. Equisetum giganteum vase life may have been longest in control treatment, because citric acid and sugar did not favor water consumption.},

The main species are Halocynthia aurantium, H. roretzi, Microcosmus hartmeyeri, M. sabatieri, M. vulgaris, Polycarpa pomaria, Pyura chilensis, Styela clava, and S. plicata, and they may be eaten raw, cooked, dried or pickled. Historically the Maoris ate Pyura pachydermatina in New Zealand. Aboriginal people ate P. praeputialis in Australia, and although it is now only used for fishing bait in that country, it is eaten in Chile where it has invaded Antofagasta Bay. There is a large market for cultured tunicates, especially among Asian populations. Styela clava and S. plicata have become extremely abundant in many countries as non-native introductions; they could easily be harvested and sold as seafood in these newly colonized regions, as could other common solitary stolidobranchs that have not previously been consumed. However, hurdles remain; diseases and overexploitation can significantly reduce cultured product and wild populations. Recently, the disease ‘soft tunic syndrome’ caused up to a 70% loss of H. roretzi crop in Korea, and harvesting wild P. chilensis reduced their numbers three fold in some parts of Chile. Most aquaculture operations are located in bays with urban runoff where pollutants including heavy metals and toxic substances could accumulate in tunicates. Natural disasters like tsunamis can also negatively impact aquaculture, as happened in Japan in 2011. Nevertheless, with proper culturing, monitoring, and preparation certain edible tunicate species that are currently an underutilized but highly nutritive food in many parts of the world could be easily cultivated, and the huge numbers of invaders could be harvested and marketed. © 2016 The Author(s).},

Using multivariate analysis to relate environmental and biological data, and diversity and biotic indices (ChBMWP, ChIBF), we analyzed the macroinvertebrate composition of 12 rivers of the semiarid region of northern Chile. A non-metric multidimensional scaling for macroinvertebrate taxa and a principal component analysis for environmental variables strongly separated upstream sites (e.g. Vacas Heladas and Malo Rivers), which presented low pH and high dissolved metal concentrations, from other sites. Effectively, CCA showed that metals and low pH, associated with the altitudinal gradient, determined the distributional patterns of macroinvertebrates in the Elqui catchment. The causes of these particular conditions could be related to geological processes and human impact. The biotic indices applied to the sampling sites corroborated and reflected these characteristics, with La Laguna and Turbio Rivers showing a diverse macroinvertebrate community and moderate to good water quality, and the Claro River showing favorable conditions for the development of aquatic biota, indicating its better quality relative to other stations. To the middle and low part of the basin, a change in the composition of the community was observed, with species that suggest an impact by an increase in organic matter, due to agricultural activities and urban settlements concentrated in this area. Our results suggest that macroinvertebrate taxa in northern Chile may be exceptional species, adapted to unfavorable geochemical conditions, and emphasize the need for protection of the semiarid basins of the region. © ONEMA, 2013.},

This review presents the first synthesis of information on the distribution and size of Kelp Gull colonies at the country level in coastal environments of Uruguay, Chile and Peru; provides an update on the breeding situation of the species in Brazil and Argentina; and allows the first evaluation of the overall coastal breeding population in South America. The breeding population in South America is now estimated to number at least 160,000 pairs. The largest population (at least 106,000 breeding pairs) is found in Argentina. Colonies of more than 1,000 pairs are uncommon. Population trends differed among coastal sectors, and important increases in numbers and formation of new colonies were only observed in Argentina. Available information suggests that predictable and abundant anthropogenic food subsidies, such as fishery discards and urban waste, are key factors contributing to the population growth in some coastal sectors. There is no strong evidence that Kelp Gulls are currently expanding their breeding range. However, given the population expansion in some areas and the potential conflicts with humans, ongoing monitoring efforts and population evaluations are necessary as they will provide the information required to support management decisions.},

Recent comparative analyses of the post-cranial morphology show that huemul cannot be associated with rock-climbing species, but falls within ranges of other cervids. Interpretations of past human utilisation rely on one study of economic anatomy and bone remains, frequently concluding that huemul was unimportant to hunter-gatherers. However, considering only bone fat and omitting easily removable fat is erroneous. Total energy of deer in autumnwinter partitions into 53% as fat and hunter-gatherers elsewhere focussed on deer during the peak fat cycle, using all easily removable fat (1200% more energy than in bones) and consuming fat and marrow while butchering. Natives are likely to have influenced huemul distribution and density in winter ranges due to high incentives (fat) and easiness to kill. Sparse evidence is likely the result of surveys in Patagonia having been biased towards caves, leaving out transient movements and camps. Generalist cervids passed the Panama land-bridge filter to reach South America. Considering paleoclimate, Hippocamelus dispersed east of the Andes, pushed by glaciations even to north-eastern Brazil. Hippocamelus would reach and cross Andes only after deglaciations. As a mixed feeder, huemul utilised Patagonian steppe. Hunter-gatherers arrived after the last glaciation and influenced the local distribution of Hippocamelus, especially in northern and central Chile, after early adoption of an agricultural lifestyle. Introduction of horses converted native economies through adoption of an equestrian lifestyle and arrival of millions of introduced livestock, which thus affected early writings. Only few records indicate the presence of large groups of huemul far from forests, and substantial killings. Human-caused range contractions of northern ungulates affected mainly losses at low elevations and most species persisted in the marginal periphery, including high-elevation refuges. Paleoecology, zoogeography and land-use history in southern South America indicate that mountain huemul is a secondary relict created by impacts of post-Columbian colonisation. We caution against the rigid application of modern huemul habitats in interpreting past habitat use and huemul ecology, and simply considering the few extra-Andean accounts as abnormal outliers. © 2012 CSIRO.},

Since then, it has spread over 4,000 km, contributing to conservation issues, mostly associated with native and urban trees of the Cupressaceae. In the present work, the morphometric variation of C. cupressi was examined to determine if the species present in Chile corresponds to a specific entity, and to identify variations among specimens from different localities in the study area. Colonies were collected from urban trees from northern, central, and southern Chile. Morphometric data for 14 characters in aphids from 63 localities in all the distribution ranges were measured and analyzed by multivariate analysis. Results showed that the species present in Chile corresponds to C. cupressi like a single specific entity, showing no morphological variation across the regions sampled.

	abstract = {The abundance of woodland birds in fragmented forest landscapes may depend on the properties of patch networks. Understanding the consequences of deforestation on woodland birds, therefore, necessarily requires determining which changes in landscape structure make a major contribution to the degradation and subdivision of patch networks. In this study, we addressed how accelerated deforestation in central Chile has modified the landscape structure and function for thorn-tailed rayaditos-a woodland specialist bird. Using a graphical approach based on the habitat use and movement patterns of rayaditos, we quantified the reduction of the internal connectivity of components (i. e., connected patch networks) in the last two decades and determined the main mechanisms responsible for this connectivity loss. Forest cover decreased 61. 7 % between 1989 and 2009. The component size, the fraction of components with ≥1 occupied patches and the number of patches per component experienced a large decline during the study period. Over time, most forest cover (ca. 80 %) was contained in only two components. The connectivity of components decreased steeply by 90 %. Only the loss of large patches made a highly significant contribution to explaining changes in connectivity, while the removal of stepping stones was marginally significant. The conversion of forest both to shrubland and to peri-urban areas were the only land-use variables explaining connectivity change with effects that changed over time. Conservation measures to ensure persistence of rayaditos populations in central Chile should be focused on the retention of key elements for connectivity. © 2013 The Ecological Society of Japan.},

	abstract = {The hoary mustard (Hirschfeldia incana (L.) Lagr.-Foss.) is a recently alien weed in Chile, recording a rapid increase in local abundance and spread. This species is distributed mainly on urban ecosystems, and field observations suggest that seed germination may have a key role to understanding its population persistence. In this line, it has been suggested that a successful germination strategy for weeds is to have both persistent seeds in the soil as rapidly germinable seeds, extending the ability to germinate over time. We evaluated germination of seeds of H. incana according to different harvest years (2010, 2011, and 2012), searching to understand how harvest time affects seed germination. For this proposal, seeds were cultivated at different temperatures (eight levels between 5 and 40 °C), covering a wide thermal gradient. Our results showed a lower germination percentage (43 %) in seed harvested in 2012 compared to the harvested in 2010 and 2011 (both cases >60 %), supporting that Hirschfeldia delay seed germination but keeping a seed stock able to germinate the same year in which were produced. The maximum germination percentage (>80 %) occurred with temperatures between 20 and 35 °C, and germination did not occur at 5 °C. These results suggest that temperature is not limiting the geographical spread of H. incana in Chile, as temperatures <5 °C are unusual. Thus, we expect that H. incana may increase its local abundance and latitudinal spread, if appropriate measures are not taken in Chile. © 2015, Botanical Society of Sao Paulo.},

An extensive survey was completed using DNA barcoding methods to identify Chilean mealybugs to the species level. Moreover, a fine-scale study of Ps. viburni genetic diversity and population structure was carried out, genotyping 529 Ps. viburni individuals with 21 microsatellite markers. Samples from 16 localities were analyzed using Bayesian and spatially-explicit methods and the genetic dataset was confronted to host-plant, management and environmental data. Chilean crops were found to be infested by Ps. viburni, Pseudococcus meridionalis, Pseudococcus longispinus and Planococcus citri, with Ps. viburni and Ps. meridionalis showing contrasting distribution and host-plant preference patterns. Ps. viburni samples presented low genetic diversity levels but high genetic differentiation. While no significant genetic variance could be assigned to host-plant or management strategy, climate and geography were found to correlate significantly with genetic differentiation levels. The genetic characterization of Ps. viburni within Chile will contribute to future studies tracing back the origin and improving the management of this worldwide invader. © 2015, Nature Publishing Group.

	abstract = {It has been estimated that more than 30% of the global land surface is subject to a considerable frequency of vegetation fires (Chuvieco et al., 2008). Li et al. (2013, 2014) argue that fire is an important Earth system process and the primary terrestrial ecosystem disturbance agent on a global scale and it depends on vegetation characteristics, climate, and human activities, and generates feedbacks by affecting biogeochemical cycles, vegetation composition and structure, land-atmosphere water and heat exchanges, atmospheric chemistry and composition, and human health and property. Although wildland fires are characteristic of certain regions and seasons, vegetation fires occur with varying regularity and severity across almost every biome on Earth (Archibald et al., 2013). Earth's forests and vegetation provide a vast source of fuel, and fires consume huge quantities of biomass in all ecosystems ranging across all biomes, from tundra to savanna and from boreal to tropical forests, where many of our ecosystems are considered fire dependent (Belcher, 2013). It is both friend and foe to the human race, having strongly influenced our social development and success as a species, yet it remains a serious threat to human life (Belcher, 2013) Even today, in some climates, fires are a natural phenomenon, but most of the fires are caused by human activity and only a minor part are produced by environmental factors (FAO, 2001). Equally, a only relatively small number of forest fires are responsible for the very high proportion of the total damage (Strauss et al., 1989). Due to ongoing global changes (Tavsanoglu and úbeda, 2011), it is expected that fire regimes will immediately respond to climate change (Bento-Gonçalves et al., 2012) in terms of frequency, size, seasonality, recurrence, and fire intensity and severity. In particular, some studies suggest that current fire regimes may cause disasters (Kazanis and Arianotsou 2004; Rodrigo et al. 2004; de Luís et al. 2006; Arnan et al. 2007). The present book intends to outline different perspectives regarding the wildland fires, the mega fires, de wildland-urban interfaces, the ecosystem impacts and presents different studies-case from 8 countries (Portugal, Spain, Greece, Israel, Algeria, Russia, Lithuania and Chile), including, therefore, 11 valuable contributions that reflect its title: "Wildland Fires - A Worldwide Reality". © 2015 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

	abstract = {The volatile monoterpene α-pinene has been measured in sediments of a selected area at "Carlos Anwandter" Nature Sanctuary, a Ramsar protected wetland located at the northwest of Valdivia City, southcentral Chile. The ecosystem was seriously damaged by an uncontrolled liquid emission of a pulp mill (CELCOArauco) located about 15 km upstream of Rio Cruces during 2004. Exploratory data analysis was applied to analytical data collected from sediment samples, having found α-pinene as a reiterative chemical at relatively high concentrations in some specific areas of the wetland. The decrease of the total concentration of α-pinene in the area under study is coincident with a point contamination that occurred during 2004 (12,240 ng g-1) showing a decay in 2005 (7,890 ng g-1) and middle of 2006 (4,060 ng g-1). The following years, last 2006, 2008, and 2009, show a relatively constant concentration with a clear tendency toward baseline levels (2,460-2,640 ng g-1). Since the decrease of concentrations of α-pinene in sediments in the period 2004-2009 shows an opposite trend as compared to the surface area increase of pine and eucalyptus plantation in Region de Los Rios, and not having found potential sources of α-pinene by anthropogenic activities other than the pulp mill in the area under study, it may be finally concluded that this compound did not enter the bodies of water from a gradual and natural process; instead there is a base to sustain anthropogenic input. α-Pinene in sediments may be a plausible chemical tracer capable of detecting pollution events over time and its impacts in aquatic ecosystems as well as changes in aquatic ecosystems produced by improperly treated pulp mill liquid emissions that use pine and eucalyptus species. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2013.},

Variables were compared between 30 trees with nests and 30 randomly selected trees without nests. Nests were found in big trees with large diameters and heights. However, the only variable found to have a significant effect on site selection was tree species, which explained 57.9% of data variability (deviance) and suggested a selection of exotic conifers, mainly Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii). Tree species and tree diameter also had significant effects upon the number of nests per tree, jointly explaining 68.9% of data deviance. Our results suggest that in urban environments the Black-faced Ibis uses larger trees that provide greater nest stability and protection. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

	abstract = {A receptor model analysis has been applied to ambient PM2.5 measurements taken at Santiago, Chile (33.5°S, 70.7°W) in 2004 (117 samples) and in 1999 (95 samples) on a receptor site on the eastern side of the city. For both campaigns, six sources have been identified at Santiago and their contributions in 1999/2004 are: motor vehicles: 28±2.5/31.2±3.4%, wood burning: 24.8±2.3/28.9±3.3%, sulfates: 18.8±1.7/16.2±2.5%, marine aerosol: 13±2.1/9.9±1.5%, copper smelters: 11.5±1.4/9.7±3.3% and soil dust: 3.9±1.5/4.0±2.4%. Hence relative contributions are statistically the same but the absolute contributions have been reduced because ambient PM2.5 has decreased from 34.2 to 25.1μg/m3 between 1999 and 2004 at Santiago. Similarity of results for both data sets - analyzed with different techniques at different laboratory facilities - shows that the analysis performed here is robust. Source identification was carried out by inspection of key species in source profiles, seasonality of source contributions, comparison with published source profiles and by looking at wind trajectories computed using the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) from USA's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA); for the wood burning sources the MODIS burned area daily product was used to confirm wildfire events along the year. Using this combined methodology we have shown conclusively that: a) marine air masses do reach Santiago's basin in significant amounts but combined with anthropogenic sources; b) all copper smelters surrounding Santiago - and perhaps coal-fired power plants as well - contribute to ambient PM2.5; c) wood burning is the second largest source, coming from residential wood burning in fall and winter and from regional wildfires in spring and summer. The results of the present analysis can be used to improve emission inventories, air quality forecasting systems and cost-benefit analyses at local and regional scales. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The guiña (Leopardus guigna) is a small felid found primarily in temperate mixed forests of southern Andean and coastal ranges in Chile and Argentina. It is considered a vulnerable species, and is one of the least studied felids in the world. In this study our main aim was to document the relationship between the activity pattern of the guiña and that of its main prey in the Valdivian rainforest (Comau Fjord, southern Chile) using a camera-trap survey. We documented the activity patterns of small mammals and two ground-foraging bird species, as these have been previously cited as the main prey of this felid. Guiñas showed two nocturnal activity peaks, at the beginning and the end of the night, and a weak peak of activity at midday. Small mammals consistently revealed nocturnal activity, whereas both birds were strongly diurnal. Our results revealed a high overlap between the activity patterns of guiñas and small mammals, whereas this was negligible for the bird species. These findings support the idea that small mammals are guiñas' preferred prey in the Valdivian rainforest. Our study contributes to the understanding of the temporal relationships between the guiña and its prey, and may help to design effective management strategies to conserve this vulnerable felid. © 2014 Deutsche Gesellschaft für Säugetierkunde.},

Leioproctus rosellae is currently known only from the holotype, while H. tayrona is known from a few specimens from the type locality. The discovery of these species in northern Colombia considerably extended the distribution of Leioproctus Smith (sensu Michener, 2007) and Heriades Spinola in the Western Hemisphere. In the Americas, Leioproctus was known from Chile and Argentina to central Peru and northeastern Brazil, while Heriades was known from southern Canada to Panama and the Greater Antilles (Michener 2007). The discovery of H. tayrona also represented the first record of the tribe Osmiini for South America. The specimens described herein were collected by sweep netting bushes along banks near the city of Santa Marta, Magdalena, Colombia (see below). The sampling area was characterized by small fragments of dry forests among abandoned pastures and secondary vegetation. Viguiera mucronata S.F. Blake (Asteraceae) was the predominant plant in bloom. Specimens are deposited in the Instituto de Ciencias Naturales (ICN), Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Bogotá, Colombia, and in the Snow Entomological Collection (SEMC), Division of Entomology, University of Kansas Natural History Museum, Lawrence, Kansas, USA.

	abstract = {After the eruption of the Chaitén Volcano (Chile) and the destruction of the neighboring Chaitén city, some alternative sites were evaluated for the relocation of administrative facilities and housing for the displaced. Three towns (Fandango, Santa Bárbara and Bahía Pumalín) were evaluated by means of a multi-criteria analysis, including the impact that a new urban development would have on local biodiversity. This impact was evaluated through a landscape analysis. The landscape attributes studied were (1) composition and representation of each ecosystem type, (2) connectivity, and (3) environmental value, based on a classification of the prevailing ecosystems and their respective stages of succession, defined as a function of ecosystem heterogeneity and maturity. Landscape metrics were calculated from LANDSAT 5 satellite imagery (November 17 th, 2008) with ArcView® 3.2 (ESRI) and Fragstats, including the surface co ver of each ecosystem type, the number of patches and the cohesion index (CI). Environmental value was determined qualitatively in situ. Santa Barbara was selected by authorities as the best place for New Chaitén City. Over 70 % of this is area is covered by forest, achieving a high degree of forest connectivity (CI > 99.0) and shrubs (CI > 94.0), with an advanced stage of succession, a high level of heterogeneity (species and strata) and a high level of inland environmental value. On the coast, Santa Bárbara has anthropic influence, but maintains an advanced state of succession, a high level of heterogeneity, and a medium-high degree of environmental value. Regarding the future urban development at this location, the recommendations were: maintenance of riverside integrity and the continuity of forests in Santa Bárbara. The proposed methodology proved to be: (1) useful for biodiversity assessment, despite the lack of information at species level, (2) easily replicable, due to the use of standard categories (ecosystem types) and easier access to satellite images, and (3) able to integrate environmental criteria at early stages of decision making in land use and urban planning processes.},

	abstract = {Aim : Global conservation assessments recognize the mediterranean biome as a priority for the conservation of the world's biodiversity. To better direct future conservation efforts in the biome, an improved understanding of the location, magnitude and trend of key threats and their relationship with species of conservation importance is needed. Location : Mediterranean-climate regions in California-Baja California, Chile, South Africa, Australia and the Mediterranean Basin. Methods : We undertook a systematic, pan-regional assessment of threats in the mediterranean biome including human population density, urban area and agriculture. To realize the full implications of these threats on mediterranean biodiversity, we examined their relationship with species of conservation concern: threatened mammals at the global scale and threatened plants at the subecoregional scale in California, USA. Results : Across the biome, population density and urban area increased by 13% and agriculture by 1% between 1990 and 2000. Both population density and urban area were greatest in California-Baja California and least in Australia while, in contrast, agriculture was greatest in Australia and least in California-Baja California. In all regions lowlands were most affected by the threats analysed, with the exception of population density in the Chilean matorral. Threatened species richness had a significant positive correlation with population density at global and subecoregional scales, while threatened species were found to increase with the amount of urban area and decrease as the amount of natural area and unfragmented core area increased. Main conclusions : Threats to mediterranean biodiversity have increased from 1990 to 2000, although patterns vary both across and within the five regions. The need for future conservation efforts is further underlined by the positive correlation between species of conservation concern and the increase in population density over the last decade. Challenges to reducing threats extend beyond those analysed to include human-environmental interactions and their synergistic effects, such as urbanization and invasive species and wildfires. © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

In 2001, the American mink (Mustela vison) was recorded for the first time on Navarino Island, in the Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve (55 S) in Chile, representing the southernmost population of mink worldwide. In order to assess its potential impact on native fauna, we studied its diet on Navarino Island, as part of an integrative management program on invasive species. Over a three-year period (2005-2007) we collected 512 scats in semi-aquatic habitats: marine coasts,riparian and lake shores. Overall, the main prey was mammals (37 % biomass), and birds (36 %), followed by fish (24 %). Over the spring and summer, mink consumed significantly more birds, whereas mammals constituted the main prey over the autumn and winter when migratory birds had left the area. Among birds, the mink preyed mainly on adult Passeriformes, followed by Anseriformes and Pelecaniformes, caught as chicks. Among mammals, the exotic muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus) was the most important prey, and together with the native rodent Abrothrix xanthorhinus it accounted for 78 % of the biomass intake. For an integratedmanagement of invasive exotic mammal species on Navarino Island and in the Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve it is important to further research interactions established here among the various introduced mammals, and toinitiate immediate control of the mink population in its initial stage of invasion.},

	abstract = {Invasive species can increase fire frequency and intensity, generating favorable conditions for their self-perpetuation. Mediterranean south-central Chile may be especially prone to the effects of invasive species on fire regimes because it is less adapted to fire and it contains a highly endemic flora. Teline monspessulana (L.) K. Koch (syn. Cytisus monspessulanus L.; Genista monspessulana (L.) L.A.S. Johnson) is an introduced shrub that forms monotypic stands or is present as an understory species in native forests as well as in forestry plantations. Dense T. monspessulana stands are completely destroyed by fire, generating the conditions for it seeds to germinate and establish an abundant regeneration, with up to 900 plants/m2. We report key evidence on abundance and biomass in adult stands, and patterns of seed bank and regeneration after fire in stands of T. monspessulana around the city of Concepción, Chile. We estimated living biomass in pure stands and underneath Eucalyptus plantations. In burned areas, we assessed T. monspessulana seed bank and studied regeneration patterns. We found that T. monspessulana densities reaches 52,778 plants/ha and 8.92 ton/ha in pure stands and 34,223 plants/ha and 2.31 ton/ha underneath Eucalyptus plantations. T. monspessulana generates small caliper fuel and acts as a ladder-fuel. Large soil seed banks allow for abundant regeneration after fire, with mean densities of 877,111 plants/ha, but an overall mortality of 37.2% in the first year after the fire. The high values of regeneration compared to final densities in adult stands suggest that density-dependent mortality. Our results indicate that T. monspessulana regeneration is not only favored by fires, but also that the species creates favorable conditions for intense and continuous fires, both under pure conditions, but also associated to exotic tree plantations. To understand the implications of positive feedbacks between invaders and fire, we recommend focusing in the mechanisms by which they increases fuel accumulation and fuel flammability, and how higher fire frequency and intensity favors invasive species recruitment over native species. Comprehension of this dynamics will allow for better management and control of these invasions which have major ecological, economical and social implications. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

	abstract = {The work aims to identify the similarities and differences in outcomes and structure of seven formulas that are used to assess damage of urban trees, which are implemented in 10 municipalities in Chile. The field work was conducted by one evaluator during 2008 in the city of Talca, Chile, applying each formula on two trees of 14 typical species of the city. All variables from each formula were measured. Results could identify three sets of formulas: (a) formulas that update the monetary value of establishment and maintenance of trees, which are applied by Antofagasta, La Florida, Renca, and Talca municipalities; b) formulas considered at Ñuñoa and Vitacura municipalities, which incorporate the tree damage as a unique discrimination variable; and c) formulas that included aesthetic, situational and state variables, which are applied by Concepción, La Pintana, Maipú and Peñalolén municipalities. The 196 valuations showed a wide dispersion of the monetary value, from US$118.9 to US$25, 663.9 for the same tree, which does suggests that better patterns common in the formulas should be found. Local Police Courts do the assessment, however the wide range of results renders it necessary to revise the formulas applied in the country to reduce the differences found among them. The objective is to find a formula that represents the true value of urban trees, which considers maintenance, damage, aesthetic, functional and situational variables. Thus, it may reduce the large differences detected, and may be used by the law in more consistent way, while being applied in the country's municipalities.},

	abstract = {During the 2002 growing season a research was conducted in order to establish the causal agents responsible for "soft rot" in stems and tubers of calla (Zantedeschia spp.) in greenhouse productions in Southern Chile. In order to compare with local bacterial isolates, "soft rot" was induced in potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) tubers from commercial productions near the city of Valdivia. To establish differences in virulence, potato isolates were inoculated on calla tissues and viceversa. 33 isolates were determined to belong to the genus Erwinia (carotovora group) (E.c.) accordingly to the following characteristics: Gram (-), oxidase (-), potato rot. Complementary and more specific tests included, sensitivity to erythromycin, utilization of palatinose, reducing substances from sucrose, acid production from amethyl glucoside and growth at 37°C. Finally, it was possible to identify two isolates of E.c. subsp. atroseptica and 21 E.c. subsps. carotovora isolatedfrom calla plants tubers. There was no evidence of the phytopathogenic species E. chrysanthemi among the isolates studied, an indication that this bacterial pathogens is absent in Chile. This is the first report indicating that isolates of Erwinia carotovorasubsp. atroseptica are affecting a new crop in Chile, such as calla. The cross inoculations performed demonstrated that virulence is more aggressive with isolates originated obtained from calla tissues. Chances that the isolates obtained from calla came from abroad are very high, and may interfere with local crops such as potato. © 2006 Instituto de Investigaciones Agropecuarias, INIA.},

	abstract = {Wetlands are one of the most productive ecosystems which provide a number of ecosystem functions, maintaining also a high biodiversity. Nevertheless, almost half of the wetlands in the world have disappeared in the last century due to urban development process. Along the Chilean landscape a great variety of aquatic habitats exist. Due to urban expansion those ecosystems have been exposed to strong anthropogenic pressures. In the intercomunal area Concepción-Talcahuano- San Pedro (Biobío Region), more than 23 % (1,734 ha) of the wetland areas have been lost in the last three decades. We evaluated the relationship between habitat characteristics (morphometric, limnology and vegetation) and the insect assemblage's structure in seven freshwater marshes in this intercomunal area. Our aim was to assess the influence of urbanization on the diversity patterns of these ecosystems. Insect abundance and species diversity were positively correlated to matrix pristinness and oxygen concentration of the water, this last feature was the best predictor for the structure of the insect assemblage. Of the 24 insect morphospecies included in the analysis, the abundance of only seven species was significantly related to the quantified habitat characteristics. Matrix pristinness, wetland area, vegetation heterogeneity and water oxygen concentration were positively related to species abundance, however, conductivity and water density showed a negative effect on the abundance. The insect species diversity decrease determined by the habitat characteristics associated to habitat loss, habitat fragmentation, habitat homogeneity, and wetland contamination, show that insects could be used as indicators of the urban effects on the functioning of these ecosystem. However, due to the missing biological and taxonomical information on the insect species related to freshwater marshes, only habitat characteristics with a significant effect on a high taxonomical level could be considered to establish initial recommendations for management plans. © 2006 Sociedad de Biología de Chile.},

	abstract = {The classification of the subclass Protobranchia followed here considers the families Nuculidae, Nuculanidae, Siliculidae, Sareptidae, Malletiidae, and Tindariidae in the order Nuculoida, and the family Acharacidae in the order Solemyoida. We also follow the separatation of Malletiidae from Nuculanidae, further justifying it on anatomical grounds. Fifteen protobranch species of Recent distribution in continental Chile, five Antarctic, and seven fossil species were studied. Out of a total of 35 species cited for the coast of Chile and Graham Land in Antarctica, only the following 27 are here accepted as valid: Nucula austrobenthalis Dell, 1990; Nucula (Nucula) falklandica Preston, 1912; Nucula (Nucula) fernandensis Villarroel, 1971; Nucula (Nucula) interflucta Marincovich, 1973; Nucula (Nucula) pisum Sowerby I, 1833; Ennucula eltanini Dell, 1990; Ennucula grayi (d'Orbigny, 1846); Ennucula puelcha (d'Orbigny, 1842); Nuculana (Saccella) cuneata (Sowerby I, 1833); Nuculana (Borissia) inaequisculpta (Lamy, 1906); Propeleda longicaudafaThiele, 1912; Tindariopsis sulcuta (Gould, 1852); Silicula patagonica Dall, 1908; Silicula rouchi Lamy, 1911; Yoldia (Aequiyoldia) eightsi (Jay, 1839); Yoldiella chilenica (Dall, 1908); Yoldiella ecaudata (Pelseneer, 1903); Yoldiella granula (Dall, 1908); Yoldiella indolens (Dall, 1908); Malletia chilensis des Moulins, 1832; Malletia magellanica Smith, 1875; Malletia patagonica Mabille & Rochebrune, 1889; Malletia inaequalis Dall, 1908; Malletiella sorror Soot Ryen, 1959; Tindaria virens (Dall, 1890); Tindaria salaria Dall, 1908; and Acharax macrodactyla (Mabille & Rochebrune, 1889). Nucula (N.) pseudoexigua Villarroel & Stuardo, a new species from the Strait of Magellan is described. The Antarctic species Propeleda longicaudata Thiele, 1912, is reported for the first time from the Strait of Magellan. A diagnosis for every taxonomic category and a detailed description for every species are given, including the shell features traditionally utilized, as well as the soft parts. Most features having so far been studied only on a few species of the subclass, allow a comparative analysis with the Chilean representatives, summarized as follows. (1) Size varies within the different families. Living nuculids are in general smaller than nuculanaceans and solemyaceans. The largest size found in the Chilean Nuculidae reaches 20.6 mm length in Ennucula grayi, whereas among Nuculanidae and Malletiidae, a maximum measured length of 51.0 mm was found in Malletia chilensis. A Chilean fossil of this genus measured 60 mm. (2) The studied species fall within the three known basic forms: nuculoid, nuculanoid, and solemyoid (Fig. 61). (3) No comprehensive study of hinge tendencies within each family has been attempted; such study would possibly permit to examine affinities and divergencies at lower taxonomic ranks. (4) The study of the ligament in specific taxa should be used to test the validity of prevailing models and interpretations. So far, the study of the ligament in Nuculidae and Nuculanidae has followed Owen's (1959) interpretation of an external or lamellar layer connected with the mantle margins, and another internal, fibrous layer connected to the isthmus of the mantle. A resilifer or chondrophore interrupts the two teeth series, and is directed anteriorly in Nucula and Ennucula (Fig. 3A, cdr), is more or less straight in Yoldia (Fig. 129), and is directed posteriorly in Nuculana (Fig. 3). Previously, Stempell (1898a) demonstrated that the ligament in Malletia can be divided in anterior, central and posterior parts, the central part corresponding to the resilium (inner layer of the ligament), and the anterior and posterior parts with an external origin. Thus, such similar differentiation in Nuculidae, Nuculanidae and Malletiidae, suggested that the resilium of internal position in Nucula and Nuculana, had migrated to become external in Malletiidae, without dissapearing. An intermediate stage in its position is observed in Tindariopsis, as was shown by Stempell (1898a). Relevance is given to the novel and most stimulating interpretation on the evolution of the ligament in the bivalves advanced by Waller (1990). He questions the traditional model of an amphidetic primary ligament of three layers, and proposes a protobranch stem group from which two major types of ligament for the bivalves evolved. (5) Variation in number and size of hinge teeth does not allow to use them as taxonomic features of generic or suprageneric value, but size and form may sometimes offer specific taxonomic value, as noted by Knudsen (1970) and Villarroel (1971). (6) The palps are very similar in the Nuculacea and Nuculanacea, but their homology with the Solemyidae is not well known. The palps in Solemya are not interpreted as doubled palps appendixes of other protobranchs; the palps sheets would be reduced to simple ridges (Fig. 11) in the edge of the furrow that joins the mouth with the appendixes (Figs. 15-17)(Ridewood, 1903; Morse, 1913; Yonge, 1939; Reid, 1980). The appendix or palp tentacle on the external sheet of every palp considered by Drew (1901) be equivalent of a pair of hypertrophiated fold (Figs. 10, 12, other figs., tp) differ in position according to family (Fig. 61). In the Nuculanacea, the palp appendix is located on the terminal portion of the external palp sheet (e.g., Fig. 5, Silicula rouchi; Fig. 77, Nuculana (S.) cuneata; Fig. 90, Nuculana (B.) inaequisculpta). In the Nuculidae, the palp appendix is displaced to the end, because behind it there is an additional, non-extensible structure termed the "palp caecum," which represents a pair of hypertrophiated folds (Stasek, 1965). The proximal end of the palp appendix is linked with the surface of the palp external sheets and the palp caecum (Fig. 10, bp); its musculature is fused with the posterior foot retractor. Stasek's (1961) observation of this feature in Acila was corroborated, without exception, in every species studied. Nevertheless, in almost all the cases, the appendix was found in different degrees of contraction, preventing recognition of specific differences (Figs. 4 and 62, 74 and 76, tp). (7) In a general comparative analysis, the value of the soft parts in the differentiation of the higher categories within the subclass, is corroborated; however, due to the limited available knowledge of many internal structures and the few studied species, their taxonomic role at the specific level cannot be always ascertained. On the other hand, the complexity observed in some of the internal morphological parts permitted us to set forth complementary interpretations on their possible phylogenetic value, particularly in the case of the stomach, the position of the heart, and the configuration of the various types of siphons. Although stomach morphology has been described for species of Nucula, Nuculana and Malletia, a comparison became necessary, resulting in the identification of a new caecum and changes in the interpretation of the features observed by previous authors. In fact, its study in the available species allowed the conclusion that there is not one basic type or "Gastroproteia," as proposed by Purchon (1956, 1959), but three. These are: Type Ia. Common to the genera Nucula and Ennucula and characterized by several (three or four) ciliary sorting areas and a wide extension of the typhlosole (Figs. 18-32, 60). Type Ib. Common to the genera of Nuculanidae and Malletiidae and characterized by three ciliary sorting areas and a small extension of the minor typhlosole (Figs. 33-56, 60). Type Ic. Common to the genera of Solemyidae and Nucinellidae and characterized by the absence of distinct sorting areas and lack of typhlosoles. It is not difficult to differentiate the internal and external features recognized in the stomach of Nuculacea and Nuculanacea. The dorsal hood is smaller in Nuculanacea than in Nuculacea, and the three ducts that communicate the stomach with the digestive diverticula are also different in these two superfamilies (Figs. 18-56, 60). Similar differences were found in the ciliary sorting areas and the number of folds. For instance, the three additional sorting areas as1, as2 and as3 described by Purchon (1956), although not present in all species, can also be used in interspecific differentiation. Thus, the first one was found only in Nucula (Nucula) pisum (Fig. 21) and Ennucula puelcha (Figs. 29-31), but not in the other studied species of these genera; the second sorting area was found presenting different sizes in Nucula (Nucula) pisum, Nucula (Nucula) fernandensis, and Ennucula puelcha, being largest in the latter. The third above named sorting area was not observed in the studied Nuculacea, and none were found in the studied Nuculanacea. Such differences do not back Purchon's (1987b) generalization that one description can embody all of them (Fig. 60). Undoubtedly, the complexity of the gastric shield with its biggest modification in Propeleda and Malletia is larger in Nuculanacea than in Nuculidae and Solemyidae, but presently it is difficult to establish generic or specific differences. On the other hand, folding of the typhlosoles entering the style-sac has shown specific constancy in the studied species of Nucula and Ennucula. Development of the typhlosoles in Nuculanacea shows a different pattern. (8) Attention has also been given to the number of loops observed in the gastric and medium intestine with a pattern of coiling, which according to Heath (1937) is specific, with minimal intraspecific variation as observed in Nucula (Nucula) pisum and Nucula (Nucula) pseudoexigua (Figs. 63-67). It begins on the side of the stomach and continues anteriorly in some species almost reaching the mouth. It turns then dorsally to the esophagus and continues posteriorly above the stomach, or continues ventrally to form the coils prior to its final turn backwards.},

	abstract = {Urbanization is increasingly homogenizing the biota of less developed countries. Even though urban sprawl is a worldwide problem, most studies on the effects of urbanization, and the conceptual models have focused on developed countries. South America has not escaped urbanization, and here we discuss the potential impacts of urban sprawl with respect to three ecosystems in the metropolitan area of Concepción, Chile. We consider this area a good model and fairly representative of other cities in developing countries which are also experiencing rapid and uncontrolled growth. We found that the impacts of urban sprawl on biodiversity in the metropolitan area of Concepción differ little from cities in other parts of the world: native ecosystems are replaced by pavements and buildings and what is left of the natural soil is covered with green areas dominated by non-native ornamental species. Wetlands and other peri-urban ecosystems are rapidly being destroyed, fragmented or invaded by non-native species. We found that from a study area of 32,000 ha, there was a net loss to urbanization of 1734 ha of wetlands (23% of the original) and 1417 ha (9%) of agricultural, forest and shrub land cover types between 1975 and 2000. From the total area urbanized (3151 ha), 55% corresponded to wetlands and 45% to agricultural, forest and shrub lands cover types. We see the lack of environmental awareness as a major cause of the increasing deterioration of biodiversity in urban areas of developing countries. More research is needed to fully understand the effects of urban sprawl on the biodiversity of developing countries to include these ecosystems in global conservation strategies. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of two native tree species, differing in physical structure, on the diversity of araneofauna in the Pedro del Río Zañartu (Hualpén) Botanical Park. We estimated the abundance, diversity, similarity and structure of the arboreal spider community associated with the two native trees, Peumus boldus Mol. (boldo) and Luma apiculata (D.C.) Burret (arrayán). We sampled spiders from eight randomly selected trees of each species using entomological umbrellas with vegetation beating. Sampling was conducted monthly from March 2001 to June 2002. We collected a total of 1602 specimens belonging to 7 families. The most abundant families present on the two tree species were Anyphaenidae, Theridiidae and Araneidae. We obtained similar values for the diversity indices of both tree species (1.576 for boldo and 1.288 for arrayán). Cluster analysis based on Jaccard similarity did not indicate differences between spider guilds inhabiting either tree species. In this sense, spiders are not restricted by the arboreal structure of these native tree species, but may be affected by other environmental variables such as food availability. © 2007 Universidad de Concepción.

To that goal we sequenced the cytochrome b mitochondrial gene and data were analyzed using different phylogenetic criteria such as parsimony, distance and likelihood available in the program PAUP 4.0. The different phylogenetic approaches agreed in recovering two well defined clades: one constituted by Thylamys pallidior that included specimens from the coast and the "pre-cordillera" of the Region I of Chile, and the other clade constituted by Thylamys elegans that included populations located south to the Atacama Desert. Therefore, we demonstrate that populations located in the canyons and andean areas of northern Chile belong to T. pallidior, while those located south to the Atacama desert are recognized as T. elegans, results that confirm the occurrence of two thylamyine species in Chile.},

This study aims to study the population patterns of Teline monspessulana after forest wildfires in the coastal areas of the Bio-Bio Region of Chile, which is dominated by forest plantations of Pinus radiata and Eucalyptus globulus. The study was conducted in Cerro Caracol park, located next to the city of Concepción and burned by a fire in February 2005. The study area was stratified in three sites, representing a range of cover and slope conditions. In each site, fifteen plots of one square meter were established. Seed bank was recorded at different depth in each the sites. During the spring of 2005 and summer to the fall of 2006, monthly records of density and height of T. monspessulana regeneration and other companion species were compiled for each plot. Fire destroyed all shrub and herbaceous vegetation. However, seeds of T. monspessulana in the seed bank reached to 3,975 seeds m-2, great variation across sites was detected. The average regeneration vary between sites between 12,000 and 2,131,000 plants/ha. After eight months, since the beginning of the germination, the heighest average height was recorded for the site with greater canopy cover (ca. 70 cm). Along with T. monspessulana, other introduced species regenerated such as Acacia melanoxylon and Rubus ulmifolius. At the end of the summer season, a decline of 35% in the initial T. monspessulana density was detected across the three sites. We conclude that fire is favoring the presence and dominance of T. monspessulana in areas with exotic tree plantations along the coastal zone of the Bio-Bio Region of Chile.},

	abstract = {Mediterranean-type ecosystems constitute one of the rarest terrestrial biomes and yet they are extraordinarily biodiverse. Home to over 250 million people, the five regions where these ecosystems are found have climate and coastal conditions that make them highly desirable human habitats. The current conservation landscape does not reflect the Mediterranean biome's rarity and its importance for plant endemism. Habitat conversion will clearly outpace expansion of formal protected-area networks, and conservationists must augment this traditional strategy with new approaches to sustain the mediterranean biota. Using regional scale datasets, we determine the area of land in each of the five regions that is protected, converted (e.g., to urban or industrial), impacted (e.g., intensive, cultivated agriculture), or lands that we consider to have conservation potential. The latter are natural and semi-natural lands that are unprotected (e.g., private range lands) but sustain numerous native species and associated habitats. Chile has the greatest proportion of its land (75%) in this category and California-Mexico the least (48%). To illustrate the potential for achieving mediterranean biodiversity conservation on these lands, we use species-area curves generated from ecoregion scale data on native plant species richness and vertebrate species richness. For example, if biodiversity could be sustained on even 25% of existing unprotected, natural and semi-natural lands, we estimate that the habitat of more than 6,000 species could be represented. This analysis suggests that if unprotected natural and semi-natural lands are managed in a manner that allows for persistence of native species, we can realize significant additional biodiversity gains. Lasting biodiversity protection at the scale needed requires unprecedented collaboration among stakeholders to promote conservation both inside and outside of traditional protected areas, including on lands where people live and work. © 2011 Cox, Underwood.},

The forest area of Chile has promoted and privileged the use of biological controls as part of the integrated pest management; so has Pauesia juniperorum been used to control C. cupressi; however, low levels of parasitism have been detected. Some aspects about the biology and behavior of C. cupressi and the biological control identified in our country are analyzed and discussed, as well as the measures implemented by the government considering that this was the first detection of a significant exotic pest associated with native forest species. It is proposed to assess, in the future, timing and level of parasitism of the biological control P. juniperorum, to determine if the parasitoid has been established in the whole territory or it is necessary to complement with other agents such as Lecanicillium lecanii or other biocontrol agents as Xenostigmus bifasciatus, which could be alternatively evaluated in order to reach a better control to reduce the populations of this aphid that threatens forest species of great value to our national heritage and some species used as ornamentals trees.},

	abstract = {Alien conifer invasions are affecting ecosystems across the globe, but until recently, reports of such invasions in South America were scarce. Pinus contorta was first established in Chilean Patagonia for erosion control caused by historical fires and cattle farming. Recently, the species has been planted over large areas for commercial purposes. It is well adapted to local conditions and is now spreading into natural areas. This study analyzes natural regeneration of Pinus contorta around Coyhaique city, Chile, to determine the spatial patterns of invasion. Five study sites were selected, four with grasslands dominated by exotic species and one site in the steppe. In each site, the plantation (seed source) was characterized using morphological attributes and density. Regeneration, density, height and age at different distances from the seed source were recorded, and ground cover was measured as an environmental factor influencing the invasion process. A comparative analysis was also conducted between the situation in Chile and other countries affected by P. contorta invasion. In Chile, P. contorta regeneration is significantly influenced by distance from the seed source. Higher densities are found close to the parent stand (up to 13,222 trees ha-1), decreasing as distance from the seed source increases. Age and height structure indicate that the invasion process is at an early stage, and this offers a unique opportunity to study the process of invasion and to monitor it over time. In order to preserve the distinctiveness of Patagonian ecosystem, decisive action is required to control invasive conifers, with P. contorta as the number one priority. Relative to control, there is much that can be learnt from the experiences of other countries, such as New Zealand. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

	abstract = {In Chile, fish, mussel and seaweed cultivation has expanded significantly over the last decade. This review considers the accumulated knowledge on the environmental effects of aquaculture in Chilean coastal areas, analyses the capacity of the industry to treat its waste and also gives some insight into new culture technologies and strategies that are currently under research and discussion in Chile. Data relating to the environmental impact of aquaculture in Chile are scarce and much is subject to severe methodological restrictions with regard to sampling design. Results related to the environmental effects show that seaweed cultivation can have an impact on sedimentation processes, increase of invertebrate assemblages and algal epiphytic abundances. It has also been ascertained that mollusc farming causes biodeposition, faunal changes and possible effects related to the introduction of new species, as well as pathogens and other unforeseen species. It has been affirmed that fish cultivation, in particular that of salmon species, also has an environmental impact related to organic sedimentation and changes in the fauna. However, these results indicate that, in general, the current dynamics of bays and fjords seem to be an important factor for the environmental sustainability of the salmon culture areas. Salmon cultivation has also been associated with phytoplankton blooms, but this point was not supported by a monitoring programme in southern Chile. Furthermore, there is concern related to new pathogen introduction and therapeutical applications to the fish cultures, and further research is required in this field. Regulations to protect the environment from the consequences of aquaculture activities have been adopted during the last couple of years. © 1996 Elsevier Science B.V. The main regulations are provided by international market standards. Nevertheless, these regulations can only be effective if other human activities, such as urban discharge, intensive agriculture fertilisation and pesticide utilisation, are taken into consideration, in an integrated perspective. On the other hand, the Chilean salmon farming industry in particular, would be in a position to cover the costs involved in the treatment of waste waters, if feeding management were improved in the future. Finally, active research is currently being undertaken into new cultivation strategies, such as the use of integrated cultivation and the recycling of nutrient-rich waters, which should permit the diversification of this economic activity in Chile, while minimising the environmental impact.},

Enzymatic analysis in foot, gill and abductor muscle tissues of C. gallardoi collected in central-south Chile (∼36°21′ S 73°44′W), show high activities for malate dehydrogenase (MDH), strombine dehydrogenase (STRDH) and alanopine dehydrogenase (ALPDH) and a low activity of citrate synthase (CS) and ETS (electron transport system). Positive significant correlations (log-log scale) were found between enzymatic activities involved in anaerobic metabolism (MDH versus LDH and ALPDH versus STRDH), as well as between CS and opines dehydrogenases. The ratio MDH/LDH or any other opine dehydrogenase assayed was >> 1 in all tissues analysed. These results indicate that C. gallardoi is highly adapted to the harsh anaerobic conditions of marine chemosynthesis-based communities inhabiting a reduced environment.

	abstract = {The forests dominated by Nothofagus dombeyi are amongst the most abundant and productive forests in the South American temperate region. In the lowlands of Chile Nothofagus dombeyi-dominated secondary forests with their associated tree species are common. Their diameter distribution, spatial patterns and association between species have not been studied. In this work we quantify those patterns and test whether there is a spatial association between species in a structurally complex forest created after a partial disturbance. We established a 70 x 130 m plot (0.91 ha) in the Llancahue property near the city of Valdivia (39°48 S, 73°11 W and 150 masl). We quantified the structure and the diameter asymmetry through the Weibull probability function and the asymmetry index, respectively. The spatial pattern (random, clustered and regular) of the forest and of each species, and the spatial association (indifference, repulsion and attraction) of N. dombeyi with the main species were evaluated with the uniand bivariate Ripley functions. The spatial autocorrelation for the diameter at breast height d was evaluated by means of semivariograms. This paper reports that the size distribution is influenced by some species that either resisted the disturbance or were highly resilient due to their regeneration strategies, which is confirmed by the spatial pattern in aggregates, and a strong spatial autocorrelation for the species. We found that the spatial patterns are intraspecific, and do not affect the spatial association between dominant and subordinated trees species. Finally, we suggest that partial disturbances cause a rapid transformation from a simple to a complex structure along forest succession.},

	abstract = {The longest river in Chile, the Loa, is in fact found in the Atacama Desert in the far north of the country. Being an important resource for the dry Antofagasta region, this river experiences high anthropogenic impacts due to water use for mining, urban, and agricultural activities. Unfortunately, few biological surveys have been conducted in the Loa, and the invertebrate fauna in particular is poorly known. The aim of this study is to characterize the microcrustacean species associations at various sites of the Loa River and some of its tributaries. Unexpectedly high species richness was detected at high-altitude sites, where the amphipods Hyalella fossamanchini and H. kochi were reported. At low-altitude sites only the ostracod Heterocypris panningi was found. No significant correlation was detected between species richness and salinity, nor between richness and conductivity. Although a null model community analysis indicated that the microcrustacean species associations in the Loa are largely random, species richness and altitude were significantly and positively correlated. Potential causes of this pattern include the accumulation of nutrients and pollution along the course of the river, as well as increasing temperatures in the lower-altitude zones of the river. The biogeography of the constituent members of the Loa fauna is discussed. © 2010 Brill Academic Publishers.},

	abstract = {Alstroemeria (Alstroemeriaceae) is an endemic genus of South America with two major distribution centers in the continent: Chile and Brazil. In Chile the genus is distributed from the North, near Iquique (20°13' S, 70°09' W) to the Chilean and Argentine Patagonia (53°10' S, 70°54' W). The central zone of Chile presents the highest number of species. A. presliana Herb. grows from Curicó (34°59' S, 71°14' W) to Cautín (38°45' S, 72°34' W) in Chile and Neuquén (36°50' S, 71°05' W), Argentina. A comparative karyotype study was made between a population of A. presliana subsp. presliana and a population of A. presliana subsp. australis Ehr. Bayer. Both populations presented asymmetric karyotypes, with 2n = 2x = 16 chromosomes, but with different chromosome formulae: A. presliana subsp. presliana has a haploid formula with 4m + 1sm-sat + 1st-sat + 2t, i.e., four pairs of metacentric chromosomes, one submetacentric pair with satellite, one subtelocentric pair with satellite, and two telocentric pairs. A. presliana subsp. australis has a formula with 2m + 1m-sat + 1sm + 4t chromosomes, i.e., two pairs of metacentric chromosomes, one metacentric pair with satellite, one submetacentric pair, and four telocentric chromosomes. These results indicated that the karyotype of the subspecies is very different, and it would be possible to recognize A. presliana subsp. australis as a new species.},

In the past few years, however, A. gracilipes has been brought to world attention due to its deadly attacks on nesting birds in the Seychelles and on the endemic crabs of Christmas Island. To evaluate the distribution and potential spread of A. gracilipes, I compiled and mapped specimen records from more than 700 sites worldwide. In tropical Asia and tropical islands of the Indian and Pacific Oceans, A. gracilipes occurs throughout the moist lowlands, but is not commonly found in arid regions and sites above 1200 m elevation. In tropical Africa, it is known only from Dar es Salaam and nearby Zanzibar. In tropical Australia, A. gracilipes has been recorded primarily from moist monsoon rainforests along perennial springs and streams in the northern region and in a few towns on the north and east coasts. In the Neotropics, there are records of A. gracilipes from western Mexico. In subtropical Asia, A. gracilipes ranges up to 26-27°N in northern India, southern China, and southern islands of Japan. I found only six records from latitudes >27°, two from exterminated urban populations (Auckland, New Zealand; Brisbane, Australia) and three from probably temporary populations (Valparaíso, Chile; Durban, South Africa; Zayul, Tibet). The sixth population, on Amami-Oshima Island, Japan, may or may not be temporary. Anoplolepis gracilipes is not yet known from many moist lowland tropical areas where it would probably thrive, including west-central Africa and much of the Neotropics. Populations in western Mexico are prevented from expanding eastward by a central mountain range, but may be able to spread south, around the mountains, to the Caribbean, Central America, and South America. Records from arid Baja California, Mexico indicate that A. gracilipes can invade and persist in areas with arid climates, perhaps due to moderating effects of irrigation.},

	abstract = {A cladistic phylogenetic analysis at generic level of the subfamily Amaurobioidinae is presented. The analysis is based on a dataset of 93 representative species scored for one behavioral and 199 morphological characters. Tree searches were made under equal and implied weights according to homoplasy, and the results were compared in terms of sensitivity to jackknife resampling. Mildest weighting functions produced trees more robust to resampling, and those results were selected as the working phylogenetic hypotheses. Groups of weak support as identified by jackknifing and Bremer indices are in general those that vary in resolution with different character-weighting schemes. Seven outgroup representatives were included (Malenella nana Ramírez, from Malenellinae, and six Anyphaeninae species). In this analysis Anyphaeninae, previously identified as sister group of Amaurobioidinae, is paraphyletic, but forcing its monophyly does not alter the groupings within Amaurobioidinae. The monophyly of the genera is in general well supported, but some particularly conflicting groups are discussed. In contrast, the relationships among genera are in general problematic. Amaurobioidinae is diagnosed by a pronounced indentation at the base of male palpal tegulum, and by a particular male copulatory bulb conformation, with a paramedian apophysis. The subfamily is classified in two tribes (Gayennini and Amaurobioidini); the genus Josa Keyserling, probably sister group to Gayennini, is not assigned to either tribe. The tribe Amaurobioidini is mainly diagnosed by an apical loop of the sperm duct in the male copulatory bulb. It includes 10 genera: Amaurobioides O.P.-Cambridge is restricted to seashores of southern continents. Clubiona chilensis Nicolet, transferred to Amaurobioides, is the first true record of the genus for South America. The male of Axyracrus elegans Simon, three species of Aysenia Tullgren, and three of Coptoprepes Simon are newly described. Four new genera are proposed in Amaurobioidini: Gamakia, Selknamia (described for one new species each), Aysenoides (for three new species), and Negayan (type species Gayenna tridentata Simon, including also Axyracrus coccineus Mello-Leitão, Clubiona paduana Karsch, Gayenna excepta Tullgren, Gayenna exigua Mello-Leitão, and Tomopisthes lebrumi Simon). The previously revised genera Acantlwceto Mello-Leitão and Ferrieria Tullgren are also included in the tribe. The basal branch and most intergeneric branches of the tribe have low support values. Amaurobioides and Negayan, however, are relatively well supported. The tribe Gayennini is well defined by a homogeneous conformation of male and female genitalia, with a distinctive secondary conductor and spherical spermathecae. It includes 11 genera: Gayenna Nicolet includes only G. americana Nicolet from Chile and adjacent Argentina. Arachosia O.P.-Cambridge comprises many species previously assigned to Oxysoma. Abuzaida striata Keyserling, Anyphaena oblonga Keyserling, Gayenna proseni Mello-Leitão, Gayenna duplovittata Mello-Leitão, Gayenna bonneti Mello-Leitão, Oxysoma dubium Berland, Oxysoma bifasciatum Mello-Leitão, Oxysoma cubana Banks, Oxysoma polytrichium Mello-Leitão, Phidyle bergi Simon, and Samuza praesignis Keyserling are transferred to Arachosia. The males of Arachosia bergi (Simon), A. honesta Keyserling, and Arachosia praesignis (Keyserling) are newly described. Arachosia is easily recognized by the thick setae on the anterior lateral spinnerets, and it has good support values. A very diverse group of species here assigned to the genus Sanogasta Mello-Leitão is paraphyletic in terms of Arachosia. It includes many of the species formerly placed in Gayenna Nicolet. Anyphaena maculatipes Keyserling, Clubiona maculosa Nicolet, Gayenna paucilineata Mello-Leitão, Gayenna alticola Simon, Gayenna bonariensis Mello-Leitão, Gayenna rufithorax Tullgren, Gayenna x-signata Keyserling, Gayenna approximata Tullgren, Samuza minuta Keyserling, and Tomopisthes backhauseni Simon are transferred to Sanogasta. The female of Sanogasta alticola (Simon), the males of S. x-signata (Keyserling) and S. approximata (Tullgren), and four species are newly described. The males of Monapia Carolina Ramírez and Monapia angusta (Mello-Leitão) are newly described. A new species of Oxysoma Nicolet from southern Brazil is described, and Gayenna saccata Tullgren is transferred to Oxysoma. Phidyle Simon is removed from the synonymy of Oxysoma Nicolet; the male of its only species Phidyle punctipes (Nicolet) is newly described. The genus Philisca Simon is redefined to include Liparotoma Simon. Clubiona tripunctata Nicolet and Clubiona gayi Nicolet are also transferred to Philisca. The male of Philisca hahni Simon and two species are newly described. The genus is reasonably supported, except for one basal species of questionable placement. Anyphaena punctata Keyserling, Gayenna fuscotaeniata Keyserling, Gayenna tripunctata Mello-Leitão, Gayenna reticulata Mello-Leitão, Gayenna taperae Mello-Leitão, Oxysoma quinquenotatum Simon, Oxysoina unipunctatum Simon, Oxysoma novum Mello-Leitão, Oxysoma lineatum Tullgren, and Tomopisthes frenatus Mello-Leitão are transferred to Tasata. The males of Tasata parcepunctata Simon, T. variolosa Mello-Leitão, and three species are newly described. Tasata albofasciata Mello-Leitão is transferred to Tupirinna Bonaldo, in the Corinnidae. Tomopisthes Simon includes only three species from Chile and adjacent Argentina. Chibiona horrenda Nicolet and Clubiona pusilla Nicolet are transferred to Tomopisthes. The male of Tomopisthes pusillus (Nicolet) is newly described. Two new genera are proposed in Gayennini: Araiya (Gayenna pallida Tullgren, type species and Gayenna coccinea Simon) and Gayennoides (for two new Chilean species). The genus Josa Keyserling, distinguished by a femoral apophysis on the male palp, is extremely diverse in Andean cloud forests and tropical America. It is one of the better supported groups of the analysis. Anypliacna keyserlingi L. Koch, Gayenna andesiana Berland, Gayenna simoni Berland, Gayennella riveti Berland, Haptisus nigrifrons Simon, Haptisus analis Simon, Haptisus maurus Simon, Olbophthalmus lojensis Berland, Olbus personatus Simon, Olbus gounellei Simon, Tetromma luteum Keyserling, and Tomopisthes chazaliae Simon are transferred to Josa.

	abstract = {This study was carried out in order to establish glucose, lactic acid, β-hidroxibutirate (β-HBA), urea, creatininkinase (CK), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), calcium (Ca), inorganic phosphorus (Pi) and magnesium (Mg) blood concentrations in loadcart draught horses in Valdivia, Chile, and the degree of adaptation of these animals to the exercise performed. Also, the relationship of these concentrations with the sex, age and parasite egg counts of the horses were determined. Sixty serum and plasma samples obtained from clinically healthy, 3 to 20 years old, crossbred geldings and non pregnant mares, were used. Before taking samples, the animals were left to rest for at least 30 minutes, and then subjected to a general clinical examination; name and address of the owner, race, sex, age and weight of the horses were recorded. After the examination, two blood samples were obtained by yugular venopuncture, using plain tubes and tubes with NaF. Blood mean concentrations were 7.31 ± 1.46 mmol/l, for urea; 0.15 ± 0.09 mmol/l, β-HBA; 4.62 ± 0.55 mmol/l, glucose; 2.55 ± 0.92 mmol/l, lactate; 179.74 ± 85.81 U/l, CH; 390.27 ± 148.56 U/l, AST; 2.74 ± 0.17 mmol/l, Ca; 1.03 ± 0.25 mmol/l, Pi and 0.70 ± 0.07 mmol/l for Mg. No significant differences (p > 0.05) were found when blood concentrations of the biochemical parameters analyzed were compared according to age, sex and parasite egg counts of the animals. It was concluded that loadcart draught horses in Valdivia present mean blood concentrations of plasmatic lactic acid, serum β-HBA and serum activity of CK above the ranges of reference established for the species, suggesting that they are not well adapted to the work they perform. Blood concentrations of the different biochemical parameters analyzed showed no significant correlation (p > 0.05) with the sex and age of the horses.},

	abstract = {Five identified and two unidentified Phytophthora spp. were isolated from diseased roots of dead or declining red raspberry (Rubus idaeus L.) plants sampled from 18 plantations along a >1,000-km north-south axis in Chile. The array of Phytophthora spp. isolated was strongly associated with geographical location. P. fragariae var. rubi was recovered from 75 and 60% of the plantations in the southern (40°16′ to 40°53′ S latitude) and central (34°35′ to 37°23′ S latitude) production sectors, respectively, but was not recovered from any plantation in the northern sector (32°43′ to 33°45′ S latitude). Similarly, P. megasperma and P. gonopodyides were recovered from multiple plantations in the southern and central sectors but were not recovered in the northern sector. In contrast, P. cryptogea was recovered from 80% of the plantations in both the northern and central sectors but not from any plantation in the south, whereas P. citricola was isolated from diseased plants in all sectors. In subsequent pathogenicity trials, P. citricola, P. cryptogea, and an unidentified Phytophthora sp. were equally and highly virulent on 'Heritage' red raspberry in each of three greenhouse experiments. The other species were less virulent in the experiment when soil temperatures were highest (mean weekly maximum = 27.5°C) relative to the other two experiments when temperatures were more moderate (mean weekly maxima of 19.9 and 23.7°C). Isolates identified as P. cryptogea were very similar to P. cryptogea isolates recovered previously from kiwi fruit in Chile and from deciduous fruit trees in California with respect to morphological characters and electrophoretic banding patterns of soluble mycelial proteins. Using the same criteria, isolates identified as P. gonopodyides were very similar to isolates recovered earlier from deciduous fruit crops in New York, which previously were identified as P. cryptogea sensu lato but are hereby reclassified as P. gonopodyides.},

	abstract = {Aim The Chilean long-tailed snake (Philodryas chamissonis) has a wide distribution across different latitudes and ecosystems in Chile ranging from the south of the Atacama Desert (26° S) to the extremely humid Valdivian temperate rain forest (40° S). Throughout this vast distribution, which is isolated by the Andes mountain range on the east and the Pacific Ocean on the west, there are biogeographical boundaries and large geographical barriers that must have played an important role in the distribution of genetic diversity within this species. This study aimed at elucidating the evolutionary history of P. chamissonis in Chile by analysis of mitochondrial DNA sequences.Location Chile (29°41'-38°23' S).Methods We extracted DNA from 66 tissue samples collected across different latitudes and amplified and sequenced the mitochondrial DNA control region and the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4 gene for phylogenetic and population analysis.Results Four distinct haplogroups were identified for P. chamissonis. These are highly consistent with a latitudinal geographic pattern, different ecosystems and the increase in topography towards central Chile. Three of the four haplogroups are concentrated in central Chile (33° S latitude) where the highest herpetofaunal diversity of the country is found. The Maipo River acts as historical geographical barrier for the species influenced by Pleistocene glaciation cycles, leading to a marked phylogeographical boundary. A strong population structure was found for the species (Φst = 0.78, P < 0.0001), with a high haplotype diversity (h = 0.97 ± 0.01) and nucleotide diversity (Π = 0.0151 ± 0.0077).Main conclusions At least three evolutionarily significant units (ESUs) were designated for the species, and these should be taken into account for conservation plans. Three of the four haplogroups found within P. chamissonis are already threatened because their distribution along central Chile overlaps with most of the largest cities in the country. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Throughout history, humans have used wildlife species to supply their needs, be it for clothing, meat, power or prestige (Roth and Merz, 1997). With the global growth of human populations increasing pressure has been placed upon species, either directly through exploitation or indirectly through habitat loss (Owen- Smith, 1988; Wroe et al., 2004; Burney and Flannery, 2005). In the early twentieth century this led to the establishment of reserve areas or national parks in which wildlife and their habitats were protected (McNeely and Miller, 1984). While this protectionist approach has conserved many species from extinction, it has also led to severe conflict between people and wildlife, particularly where they interact, for example on the borders of the protected areas (Woodroffe et al., 2005). However, many species of wildlife still exist outside the protected areas and a number of these species will remain viable only if these populations continue to survive in harmony with the people with whom they coexist (e.g. Gratwicke, 2007). This has led to the development of a philosophy for sustainable use of wildlife outside the protected areas (the community-based conservation approach) (Hulme and Murphree, 2001). One of the tenets of the community-based conservation approach is that, because people reap an economic return for the use of wildlife species, their attitude to wildlife will improve and will lead to communities conserving those valued wildlife species (Hulme and Murphree, 2001). Clearly, for this to be the case, the community has to have rights over the use and management of that wildlife resource and individuals have to benefit, either directly or though community-based initiatives that improve quality of life (Martin, 1986). However, while the opening up of trade for a wildlife product (trophy, meat, skin or fibre) can benefit individuals, communities and wildlife, it may also mean that individuals or groups that are denied legal benefits may opt to participate in the market through supply of poached products. This may, in the end, cause over-harvesting of the wildlife resource, resulting either in extinction or a ban on trade through local, regional or international treaties. Sustainable use of any wild species often provokes controversy and opposition (Prins et al., 2000); in a global situation of rapid loss of biodiversity, cases where wildlife species are abundant enough to be able to cope with commercial use are rare. In many cases, hunting or harvesting wild animals in the past has been one of the main factors in their numerical decline and potential extinction, which leads to conflicting philosophies between proponents of sustainable use and conservationists. Elephants and whales are iconic examples of the permanent battle waged between conservationists and promoters of wildlife use. Periodically, this issue is discussed in the CITES (Convention on Trade in Endangered Species), a global body responsible for regulating trade in wild species and their products commercialisation. It is against this backdrop that the consideration of the sustainable use of the vicuña takes place. The vicuña (Vicugna vicugna) (Fig. 1.1) provides an extremely interesting and enlightening case study of the political economy of wildlife management, as policy shifts from total conservation to a more complex, and contested, sustainable use approach. The first stage of total protection was extremely successful (McNeill and Lichtenstein, 2003); this policy received widespread support both nationally and internationally and the vicuña has become one of the few success stories of wildlife conservation. The next stage, that of sustainable use, has now been entered and the political consensus begins to break down; ongoing developments in international conservation policy within CITES, have established a legal basis for exploitation of both wild populations of vicuña and herds in captivity. This recent shift in emphasis from conservation to sustainable use requires that systems be developed that are economically viable, while maintaining adequate monitoring of the impact of management in individual animal welfare and population ecology. As many of the indigenous communities involved give religious importance to the vicuña, there is an extra socio-cultural dimension to this work. Increasing populations of vicuña are, however, raising new challenges for effective management. Internationally, policy development has followed the community-based conservation paradigm, which holds that economic benefits from wildlife management practices bring greater commitment on the part of local communities to protect both the species and its habitat. However, sustainability of the species or the environment in which it lives is not guaranteed by sustainable use, and both education and regulation are required to prevent the proliferation of unsustainable practices. The debate has now shifted to a series of unresolved questions about the sustainability of different approaches to harvesting and marketing fibre should wild or captive management be adopted; how should benefits be distributed between individuals and communities; how humane is the capture, of wild animals for fibre harvesting and what policy instruments need to be put in place to prevent poaching and the development of an illegal fibre trade? The current argument for the consumptive use of vicuña is that it is based on fibre harvest from live animals and no individuals are lost as a result. Ancient traditions are invoked as one of the reasons for live animal shearing and the herding systems being adopted in several countries are an attempt to emulate those old methods. The objective is to deliver a financial return to local communities that have protected the species on their land for decades and have potentially foregone other income because of the presence of the vicuña. Community wildlife management does not replace conservation, but it does fundamentally alter the nature of the task that conservation agencies face by requiring much stronger engagement with local communities. The vicuña roams the high-altitude steppes of the Andes. It is a highly social species with males defending small family groups of females and their young (cria) all year round. The vicuñas highly-prized fleece has been both its greatest asset and its biggest downfall. Four centuries of over-exploitation since the arrival of the Spanish led to the species near extinction in the 1960s. As a consequence of effective conservation measures by both international and national legislation over the past 40 years, the vicuña has recovered to population levels that have allowed some regional populations to be moved from CITES Appendix I to Appendix II, allowing local communities to exploit the fibre from live-shorn animals. The different countries in the main range of the vicuña (Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, and Peru) have adopted different approaches to the exploitation of the species, ranging from captive management under farm conditions in Argentina, ranching systems in fenced areas in Peru and Chile and the capture and release of wild populations in Bolivia, Peru and Chile. These different management systems reflect local limitations and aspirations, but each has a different outcome both in the degree to which local communities benefit from the exploitation of the fibre, and in the contribution that such management makes to conservation of the vicuña and its habitat. The recovery of vicuña populations in the wild provides the European and USA quality textile industry with a unique opportunity to develop new top-of-the-range products based on environmentally sound wildlife management and fair trade with developing countries. This opportunity presents many challenges for the development of appropriate management systems, animal welfare and distribution of benefits among producers. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.

The Chilean samples were not related to viruses of the sylvatic cycle maintained by the common vampire bat (Desmodus rotundus) in Latin America. Five genetic variants were identified from insectivorous bats in Chile. The Brazilian free-tailed bat (Tadarida brasiliensis) was identified as the reservoir for the rabies genetic variant most frequently isolated in the country between 1977 and 1998. The close association of a group of viruses obtained from a domestic dog (Canis familiaris), Brazilian free-tailed bats, and a red bat (Lasiurus borealis) with viruses maintained by Lasiurus spp. in North America implicated species of this genus as the possible reservoirs of this particular genetic variant in Chile. Reservoirs for the other three variants remain unknown.},

	abstract = {Peruvian Terns Sternula lorata breed in the sand desert plains of the coast of Perú and northern Chile. Because of their long-term population decline, Peruvian Tern is categorized as 'Endangered' on the IUCN Red List. The observations that formed the basis for that decision were made in the 1970s and 1990s. In this study, we compile information on distribution, numbers, habitat use and threats of Peruvian Terns that has become available between 2003 and 2008 from 14 localities on the Peruvian coast. Peruvian Tern sites are located between the mangroves of San Pedro de Vice in the north (5o31′S) and the wetlands of Ite in the south (17o 56′S). From the 14 locations, five are reported for first time: Virrilá, Eten, Huanchaco, isla Mazorca and Ite. There were only four active breeding sites: Pacasmayo, Paraíso, Pampa Lechuzas and Tres Hermanas-Yanyarina; however, some localities were visited outside the breeding season and should be surveyed between October and February to search for nests. The presence of 283 individuals was confirmed at the 14 sites in an area of approximately 1,388 ha (which represents only 0.35% of the total suitable area for nesting along the Peruvian coast). Thus, the number of Peruvian Terns in Perú should increase with systematic surveys. Here for the first time we report the importance of wetlands for the Peruvian Terns (43% of the sightings occurred in this habitat). Wetlands can offer optimal conditions for feeding, but the cost of using them is becoming higher with a sharp increase of human expansion into coastal areas and urban development around wetlands. We identified the following threats affecting Peruvian Terns on their feeding and breeding grounds: 1) recreational activities; 2) off-road driving by fishermen and tourists; 3) wetland pollution and water use for irrigation; 4) conversion of desert plains to agricultural land; 5) management of wetland water levels; 6) presence of feral cats and dogs, and 7) oil exploration on the desert plains. These adverse factors can be eradicated by the protection of tern sites and public awareness and education. Conservation actions, monitoring and research priorities are suggested. © 2009 BirdLife International.},

A sample of 31 healthy dogs of the city of Chillán, Chile were used, from which gastric fungus biopsies were obtained by endoscopy. These biopsies were put under the Rapid Urease Test. The owner of these canines were all positive for helicobacteria, determined by means of the same test. Ninety sevent percent of the canine biopsies were positive for helicobacteria. Thirty nine percent of the biopsies with the fastest positive reaction to the urease test belonged to canines with a high contact grade to their owners. The results suggest that the high charges of helicobacteria found in canines could be because of the higher contact grade of these animals with their owner. It would be important then to determine in future studies, whether if these pets could be a reserve or a transmission source for people, or viceverse, and the bacterial species involved.},

Fitzroya may live for over 3, 600 years, reaching 5 m in diameter and 50 m in height. More than three centuries of over-exploitation, owing to the beauty and durability of Fitzroya wood as well as human-set fires and conversion to pasture-land, have significantly reduced its original abundance and have left extensive degraded forests. Therefore, Fitzroya is considered a threatened species; cutting of living trees is prohibited and it is listed under CITES Appendix I, forbidding its international trade. Despite this protection, illegal cutting and human-set fires on these forests are widespread and its wood is still exported. Given this situation, conservation efforts in the last years have been focused on the investigation of illegal fellings, the creation of public and private protected areas, and on the research forest ecology and dynamics, genetic variation and propagation of the species. This research has formed the basis to start small-scale plantations for ecological restoration. Future conservation activities should be focused on the enforcement of the legal protection, as well as on the development of alternative uses for these forests including ecological restoration, protection in set-aside public and private areas, and ecotourism.},

In Chile, the presence of the disease has been already demonstrated in cows of the IX Region of the country. In the present study we investigated the presence of antibodies against N. caninum in dog sera. Blood samples of 201 dogs were taken from different local veterinary clinics and in rural areas of IX Region of the country, data about the dog sex, age, breed, "rural" or "urban" habitat and if they consume or not "raw meat" was collected. The 18% (36/201) of the studied animals had 1:50 dilution IFA test antibodies. There was difference in the amount of positives between rural 26% (21/81) and urban 12,5% (34/120) dog populations (OR=2,45). Only in 68% (136/201) of the cases, it was possible to determine the dog's feed, and there was also difference in the seropositives between "raw meat" (29,5%; 21/71) vs. "no raw meat" (7%; 9/65) (OR = 2,613). There were no differences by sex, breed and age. A Neospora Aglutination Test (NAT) in two sera of Chiloe's fox (Pseudolapex fulvipes) were positive (1:320), these animals are native of Chile but they were owned by a local zoo. This study shows that dogs of IX Region of Chile were infected with N. caninum, and although limited, the results suggest that the canine rural population and/or those fed with raw meat have more risk of being infected. On the other hand the positivity of the two studied foxes open interesting questions about their potential role as diffusers of the disease.},

	abstract = {Information about fungi of the orders Cyttariales, Helotialcs, Ostropales, Pezizales, Rhytismatales and Thelebolales (Discomycetes) collected in Patagonia, Tierra del Fuego and adjacent antarctic areas (Patagonia), and information about their associated organisms was located, abstracted, keyboarded, edited and validated. The largest single information sources were dried reference collections in Argentina and elsewhere, and published information as listed in this work's bibliography. Other records were derived from fresh collections, other reference collections and field observations. Information is stored in a computerized system of relational databases for taxonomic, nomenclaturel, bibliographic and biological observations data. This system allows storage of parallel data in different languages, and distinguishes original information from current opinion about what that information may mean. In the Biological Records Database, 5029 separate records were created for observations on the spatial and temporal occurrence of living organisms in the region. Of these 2613 were Discomycetes, with records derived as follows: Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego (Argentina, 1854; Chile, 687); adjacent antarctic areas (72). Excluding synonyms, these Discomycetes represented 361 species and subspecific taxa (160 genera, 22 families and 7 orders) the remaining records were organisms associated with these Discomycetes as follows: 163 of animals (8 species, 8 genera, 6 families and 5 orders); 2 of chromistans; 223 of fungi (52 species, 54 genera, 26 families and 13 orders); 2028 of plants (159 species, 122 genera, 59 families and 39 orders). Each of these different taxa (and each known synonym) is represented by a separate record in the Taxonomic & Nomenclatural Database. Information about relevant bibliographic sources is stored in more than 120 records in the Bibliographic Database. The databases were used to produce the present checklist of names given to Discomycetes observed in Patagonia. A typical entry comprises the fungus name, author(s), and information on the original place of publication of the name, together with any known synonyms (classification at generic level and above largely follows the 9 th edition of Ainsworth & Bisby's Dictionary of the Fungi, Kirk et al., 2001). This is followed by basic information derived from the databases: the number of times the fungus has been recorded from the region, the date of the earliest record from the region, months in which the fungus has been observed in the region, geographical distribution by country (and within countries by an appropriate subnational division), associated organism and substrata, a list of reference collection numbers identifying preserved specimens and sometimes living isolates of each fungus, and bibliographic citations identifying any published sources of the information. The status of each name is indicated and, where appropriate, synonyms are provided and cross-indexed. The list is accompanied by an explanatory introduction, a taxonomic index, indexes by countries and subnational divisions of the region, by taxonomy of associated organisms and by substrata, and a bibliography. No new taxa are described. Apart from four new nomenclatural combinations, no new scientific names of any son arc knowingly introduced.},

	abstract = {Oceanic islands, such as Juan Fernández in Chile, are the home for particular biotas that have evolved in isolation over a long period. The anthropogenic introduction of allochtonous plants is one of many problems for the conservation of endemic elements. In this paper, we present the new additions to the introduced flora of the Juan Fernández Islands, adding some comments about their life form, origin, morphological characteristics, ecology, distribution, abundance, and their potential of invasion. We cited 27 new species, 12 new genera, and three new families for the Juan Fernández flora (Amaryllidaceae, Commelinaceae and Violaceae). Most genera belonged to Asteraceae (seven species). Fifty-nine percent of taxa were perennial herbs, followed by annual or biennial herbs. Wind was the main vector of propagule dispersal (42 %), followed by vegetative dispersal (23 %). Fifty-two percent of the species were weeds and 44 % were plants with dual behaviour: garden-weed plant. Eurasia was the most frequent area of plant origin (70 %). Ninety-four percent of the taxa with known geographic range are in the V Region of mainland Chile, which is the main region of export of plants and materials to the archipelago, suggesting that this may have been the immediate origin of these introductions. Sixty-three percent of the species were only found in the San Juan Bautista urban area, while the remaining taxa were also (22 %) or exclusively (15 %) found in other places of the main island (Robinson Crusoe). Sixteen species (59 %) are considered as noxious weeds in Juan Fernández or elsewhere, and they should be a focus of attention and, eventually, control. Summing our findings to previous lists of introduced taxa, we obtained 260 non-native taxa in Juan Fernández. This number is greater than the native taxa (211), which demonstrate how the human intentional and non-intentional action can dramatically change the floristic composition of an oceanic archipelago. We strongly recommend the installation of a sanitary control in Robinson Crusoe Island or in Valparaíso, in association with quarantine procedures with the food vegetables, and biological products in general.},

Vicuña populations in the high Andes of Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador and Perú fell to a critically low level, but a Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) ban on trade in their fiber has seen numbers recover dramatically, and now live shearing of vicuña for a high-value international market is being promoted as a mechanism to secure both sustainable vicuña populations and local livelihoods. We used a dynamic optimization model to explore the consequences of legalizing markets, including the consequences for poaching which is critical in vicuña dynamics. Using parameters obtained from the literature and expert knowledge, we explored different scenarios for the Argentine region of Cieneguillas. Our results showed that the role of the international market is ambiguous; live shearing for an international market can provide the very best of outcomes for both vicuña and local people, with large herds generating high revenues. But an international market also creates a market for poached vicuña fiber; as a result, vicuña numbers risk once again falling to critically low levels, resulting also in minimal revenues from sale of fiber. The message for the international community is that if community-based conservation is not implemented carefully then its impact can easily be perverse. Crown Copyright © 2007.},

	abstract = {Two presumably allopatric populations of Warbling Doradito (Pseudocolopteryx flaviventris) differ in bioacoustic and morphometric characters, but are otherwise essentially identical in morphology, and it is very difficult to separate them based on plumage features alone. The song of the population from western Argentina (Chubut, Río Negro, Neuquen, Mendoza, and Salta) and central Chile, here provisionally called P. cf. citreola, can be described as "tick tick tick tick-tick-tick-you", while the song of P. f. flaviventris is "u-eet-u, u-eet". Head movements performed during song emission also differ between the two forms. The western populations do not respond to playback of nominate flaviventris, and vice versa, but both are very responsive to their own vocalizations. We found P. cf. citreola in different habitats: chilcales (Baccharis salicifolia), tamariscales (Tamarix gallica), brushland of pajaro bobo (Tessaria absinthioides) with tamarisks, tamarisks and chilcas, and lagoons with reeds (Typha sp. and Juncus sp.). The form citreola is migratory, with records from October-March in the province of Mendoza. The nest of P. cf. citreola is similar to those of other Pseudcolopteryx, but the eggs might be unique since they are speckled. Our data demonstrate that, as actually delineated, P. flaviventris includes two different biological entities (cryptic species). © The Neotropical Ornithological Society.},

Gondwanan vicariance, often cited as the cause of this classic austral biogeographical pattern, was rejected by parametric bootstrapping of our combined dataset. Alternatively, various lines of evidence are presented in favour of a South American origin of Ourisia and subsequent dispersal to Australasia. Specifically, the genus likely arose in the Andes of central Chile and spread to southern Chile and Argentina, to the north-central Andes, and finally to Tasmania and New Zealand. The ancestor of the New Zealand species probably first arrived on the South Island, where the New Zealand species of Ourisia are most diverse, and migrated to the North and Stewart Islands. Because the Tasmanian and New Zealand species are sister to one another, the direction of dispersal between these two areas is equivocal. These results agree with other molecular phylogenetic studies that show that past dispersal between southern hemisphere continents has played an important role in the evolutionary history of many high-elevation austral plants. Our data also show that within South America, many of the geographical barriers (with the exception of the Atacama Desert) that have played a role in the evolution of other plant groups have not affected Ourisia species. Within New Zealand, the phylogeny and biogeography of species of Ourisia coincide with the geological history of the country and patterns of other alpine plants. © 2006 The Linnean Society of London.},

	abstract = {In order to effectively address the problems derived from global environmental change, environmental scientists, citizens and decision-makers now recognize the need to integrate more fully the human or social component into ecological research. We propose that to achieve this integration, Long-Term Socio-Ecological Research (LTSER) networks offer an ideal platform, because such sites enable research at ecological, cultural, and political local scales, and at the same time allow addressing these issues at a global scale. However, this socio-ecological work still requires better articulation of programs developed at multiple geographic, ecological and political scales. In addition, until now the social component considered in LTSER programs has focused on economic factors, omitting ethical dimensions. A central reason for this omission is the lack of methodologies to systematically integrate ethics into LTSER programs. As a contribution to resolve this limitation, here we develop a methodological approach that we call "field environmental philosophy." It integrates ecological research and environmental ethics into biocultural education and conservation through an interrelated four-step cycle: i) interdisciplinary ecological and philosophical research, ii) composition of metaphors, and communication through simple narratives, iii) design of guided field experiences with an ecological and ethical orientation, and iv) implementation of in situ conservation areas. This cycle has been defined a posteriori, by analyzing successful experiences of biocultural research, education and conservation program at the Omora Ethnobotanical Park (OEP) in the Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve (CHBR). The Masters of Science in Subantarctic Conservation at the University of Magallanes (UMAG) adopted this cycle as a structured methodology to design theses and academic curricula for students who are creating innovative educational and ecotourism activities, such as QUOT;Ecotourism with a Hand Lens" and "Ethical Birding." To articulate the programs at multiples scales, the OEP functions at the local scale as a research center in the CHBR, at the national level as a cofounder and southernmost site of the Chilean LTSER network coordinated by the Institute of Ecology and Biodiversity (IEB), Chile, and at the international level as a reserve and field station of the Subantarctic Biocultural Conservation Program that is coordinated by UMAG, IEB and the University of North Texas (UNT). This organization of nested units has permitted to synergistically articulate the work at local, national and international scales. Collaborative research has led to the discovery of biological and cultural diversity singularities in the remote Magellanic subantarctic ecoregion, enabled education and conservation work with multiple social actors and institutions, and has strengthened the incorporation of environmental philosophy into socio-ecological research. In this way, OEP's program is contributing to broaden the definition of the social ("S") component in LTSER, and to generate methodologies to integrate, at multiple scales, ecological and ethical dimensions into socioecological research, as well as biocultural education and conservation programs, which could be implemented and assessed at other LTER sites. © Sociedad de Biología de Chile.},

	abstract = {Aim: Globally, one of the major threats to the integrity of native faunas is the loss of biodiversity that can result from the introduction of exotics. Here we document recent changes in the distribution of five common fish species that are linked to introductions in Chile. Location: Chile from 28° S to 54° S. Methods: We assess the extent of changes in distribution of galaxiid species by comparing their historical and current distributions based on the results of the most extensive survey of freshwater fishes in Chile to date, a range that encompasses the full latitudinal and elevational range of the Galaxiidae in Chile. We test for relationships of the distributions and abundances of native fishes with the incidence of introduced species. Results: The latitudinal range of Galaxias maculatus has declined by 26%, and most of this reduction has occurred in the northern part of its range. Aplochiton taeniatus and Brachygalaxias bullocki have experienced reductions (8-17% loss) in total drainage area occupied, and they have disappeared from, or are now extremely difficult to find, in latitudes 36° to 41° S, coincidently with areas of urban growth and intense economic activities. The distribution of Galaxias platei has, instead, increased considerably. In northern basins, G. maculatus has apparently been replaced by an introduced poeciliid Gambusia sp. High-elevation systems remain dominated by native Galaxias platei, whereas systems at intermediate elevations, especially rivers, are now dominated by introduced salmonids. Within drainages, native galaxiids remain abundant where exotic salmonid abundance is low. Main conclusions: We suggest that negative interactions between introduced and native fish are responsible for some of the range reductions among Galaxiidae in Chile. The severity of the impacts varies with latitude and altitude and is probably related to temperature. The effects of Gambusia are restricted to warmer systems. Native fish also appear to have found temperature refugia from salmonids; impacts are low in the warmer northern and coastal systems, as well as in high-altitude relatively cold systems. Native fish also appear less vulnerable to salmonids in lakes than in rivers. This study identifies watersheds critical for the conservation of biodiversity within the Galaxiidae. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Five new species are here described: A. calilegua n. sp. from northwestern Argentina, and four species from different regions of Chile are also described: A. changellkuk n. sp.; A. abrilae n. sp.; A. levii n. sp. and A. araucana n. sp. The type specimens of the Chilean species described by Nicolet ( 1849, under Dysdera) were examined, confirming all the synonymies established by Simon in 1896 (D. virens, D. incerta, D. coarctata and D. longipes with A. maxima). The internal genital structures show diagnostic characters for the identification of females.

	abstract = {San Carlos de Apoquindo, a piedemont area to the east of Santiago city, is a site with 30 years of data on vertebrates. Using LANDSAT satellite imagery for the years 1975, 1989 and 2003, we studied the spatiotemporal trajectory of land use and its putative effects on vegetation, small mammals and raptors. On the basis of a landscape-level analysis, we interpreted long-term trends in the abundance of small mammals and in the diet of raptors. Satellite imagery reveals an accelerated expansion of the urban area in detriment of agricultural land and native scrubland. Native mammal species of small and medium size do not display large variation of abundance during the 30 years study period, but larger-sized native mammals show reduced population numbers. The European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) currently is among the most abundant mammal species in the area, and seems to be favored by the temporal transition from dense to sparse scrubland. In the diets of Chilean Eagle (Geranoaetus melanoleucus) and of native Harris' Hawk (Parabuteo unicinctus) there is a marked decrease of the native rodent prey Octodon degus and a concomitant increase of the exotic prey Oryctolagus cuniculus. In addition, there is a decreasing trend in richness and abundance of raptors throughout the study period, which is associated to both urban expansion and scrubland fragmentation and reduction. We propose that urban encroachment, together with areal reduction and fragmentation of native scrubland, has resulted in a decrease of the Octodon degus population, and in its subsequent decrease in the diet of both native eagles and hawks, which in turn has determined increased predation on exotic rabbits. © Sociedad de Biología de Chile.},

The spatial pattern of fish communities in different biocoenotic zones of the Chillan River is influenced by both natural factors such a hydrologic features, habitat, and feeding types, and also by water quality variables which can reduce the diversity and abundance of sensitive species. A principal component analysis incorporating both water quality parameters and biomarker responses of representative fish species was used to evaluate the status of fish communities along the spatial gradient of the stream. The abundance and diversity of the fish community changed from a low in the upper reaches where the low pollution-tolerant species such as salmonid dominated, to a reduced diversity in the lower reaches of the river where tolerant browser species such as cypriniformes dominated. Even though the spatial pattern of fish community structure is similar to that found for the Chilean Rivers, the structure of these communities is highly influenced by human disturbance, particularly along the lower reaches of the river. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

This study aimed to analyze and characterize the dynamics of P. uviferum forests in the coastal range of Chiloé, specifically in four sites (one pristine and three disturbed) located near Lake Tepuhueico in the center-south of Chiloé Island. A floristic composition evaluation and quantitative, diametric and age structure analyses for each sector were conducted. Furthermore, the original stand structure of the burnt Pilgerodendron forests, existing before the fire, was reconstructed. The fire that occurred in the study area produced big changes in the habitat, exceeding the persistence threshold of P. uviferum. The disturbed zone was considerably damaged on its structure, showing substantial reductions of basal area (over 90%) and density (over 87%) for the species. This event allowed the establishment and dominance of young second-growth mixed stands of Nothofagus nítida, Drimys winteri and Tepualia stipularis which, in undisturbed sites, belong to a different succesional sequence. However, there are small pristine stands of P. uviferum that must be preserved because of their structural complexity and their importance as seed suppliers for disturbed neighboring areas. © 2008 Universidad Austral de Chile.},

	abstract = {The chameleon genus Brookesia, with 26 species, is endemic to Madagascar. The main threats to Brookesia are habitat destruction and collection for trade. At the CITES Conference of Parties 12, held in Santiago, Chile in 2002, all but one Brookesia species were added to Appendix II, under which trade is controlled in order to avoid utilization being incompatible with species' survival. The Vulnerable B. perarmata was added to Appendix I, under which trade is permitted only in exceptional circumstances. Summary information for Brookesia is presented here, reviewing taxonomy, habitat preferences, available population estimates, relevant legislation, major threats, and trade levels. Brookesia live on or close to the ground, with roost sites mostly <1 m above ground. Density estimates are available for only a few species, with a mean density estimate for four species across sites and seasons of 16 individuals ha -1. A number of species have distinct altitudinal ranges, and a preference for primary forest. Continued deforestation will therefore potentially lead to extirpations. Research on population sizes and seasonal trends of Brookesia is required, without which, combined with data on the impacts of harvesting, the establishment of sustainable trade will not be possible. The apparent reduction and possible cessation of trade in B. perarmata following its listing on CITES indicates that the Convention can succeed in managing global trade in a threatened species. © 2005 FFI.},

	abstract = {Rhaphithamnus Miers. (Verbenaceae) consists of two species restricted to southern South America. Rhaphithamnus spinosus (A. L. Juss.) Mold. occurs in mainland Chile and adjacent Argentina; R. venustus (Philippi) Robinson is endemic to the two islands (Masatierra and Masafuera) of the Juan Fernández Archipelago. Both species are related to Citharexylum Miller, a genus distributed from Peru northward along the Andes. Youthful geological ages of the Juan Fernández Islands (1-4 myr) and occurrences of the sister group also on the continent suggest that R. venustus evolved from R. spinosus rather than the reverse. Morphologically the two species differ primarily in corolla length and color and stem armament, with R. spinosus with shorter (ca. 12 mm) and bluish flowers and usually with axillary thorns in contrast to longer (ca. 25 mm) and purple flowers and lack of thorns for R. venustus. Studies of pollinators reveal bees, flies, beetles, and infrequently hummingbirds for R. spinosus and exclusively hummingbirds for R. venustus. Rhaphithamnus spinosus is hermaphroditic and partially self-compatible, whereas R. venustus is gynodioecious and with an unknown compatibility system. In the latter species female flowers appear to be in an early stage of evolution because anthers are still fully formed, but usually without pollen grains. Embryological studies reveal break-down of pollen mother cells (and tapetal cells) during meiosis. We hypothesize that evolution of floral features in R. venustus is a result of a change from primarily insect to hummingbird pollination; loss of thorns may result from absence of herbivores in the Islands. Gynodioecy in Rhaphithamnus may have as its selective basis reduction of inbreeding depression otherwise brought on by geitonogamy in scattered individuals of small populations.},

	abstract = {Central Chile supports a rich native flora and a high proportion of alien, naturalized plants. To increase our knowledge about behavior of naturalized plants in central Chile, the flora of the western slope of the Coastal Range (Province Valparaiso, 33°S lat.), was recorded and analyzed. Study sites were placed at natural and anthropic, perturbed areas. Taxonomic richness, species composition, geographic origin, Raunkiaer's life forms, and absolute coverage were recorded. Of the 325 vascular plant species were identified, 110 (34%) were considered alien; 74% of them with European origin, and 10%, European-North African. According to abundance, 27 % of the plant coverage was of native species and 73% of non-natives. The natives were distributed in 68 families and the naturalized and cultivated in 28 families. Asteraceae, Poaceae y Fabaceae were the richest in both native and naturalized species. The native species were distributed in 146 genera and non natives in 89. Alstroemeria, Baccharis and Calceolaria were the richest in native species; Erodium, Trifolium, Rumex and Vicia, were rich in alien species. Hemicryptophytes and therophytes were most abundant in natives and naturalized species. We conclude that due to increasing urban and agricultural pressures on soils in Province Valparaíso, it is expected that short-lived alien species with opportunistic, high-reproductive capacity, will increase in diversity and abundance.},

Several variables were measured for both the vascular epiphytes and their host-trees. We studied the floristic composition of the vascular epiphytes community, and their relationship with their host-trees, as well as their sociability, cover, and frequency. Eight vascular epiphytes species were identified, corresponding to four genus distributed in three families: Hymenophyllum and Hymenoglossum (Hymenophyllaceae), Asplenium (Aspleniaceae) and Sarmienta (Gesneriaceae). We found only a non-statistically significant linear correlation between vascular epiphytes and their host-trees.

In Chile is represented by about 33 species, the most of them in central Chile, an area renowned for its high level of endemism. The complex Alstroemeria hookeri is endemic to Chile and distributed from the IV Region of Coquimbo to VIII Region of Bio-Bio. The subspecies hookeri is present in the VII Region of Maule and VIII Region of Bio-Bio. In the VIII Region ofBio-Bio, there are two distribution centers ofthis subspecies separated by the Coastal Mountain. One center is located in the coastal range of the Region and the other center is located in the Central Valley, specifically on the sandy area of the Central Valley. The cytogenetic analysis of the chromosomes of coastal and eastern populations have shown a remarkable difference in the karyotype, principally in chromosome 3. In the Coastal range populations this chromosome is telocentric while in the Eastern populations is metacentric. Besides, there are differences in chromosomes 4 and 8, in the Coastal ranges populations the chromosome 4 is telocentric and the chromosome 8 is submetacentric while in the Eastern populations both chromosomes are subtelocentric. When indexes of asymmetry of karyotypes are compared among populations (AsK%, TF% and Syi), there are clear differences between populations from both geographical range. The phenetic analysis using cytological data also confirms the separation of the coastal and inland populations within Alstroemeria hookeri ssp. hookeri. It is probably that evolutionary divergence between population is occurrings and the difference in the morphology of chromosome 3 is a morphological evidence for this situation.Prelimary studies of isoenzymes, RAPD, ITS and morphology support this hypothesis.},

	abstract = {To investigate the origin and diversity of domestic guinea-pigs Cavia porcellus (Linnaeus, 1758; Rodentia, Caviidae), we sequenced the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene of 12 domestic and 10 wild specimens from six species, including the two presumed as ancestral to the domestic one: Cavia tschudii and Cavia aperea. All maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood analyses grouped C. porcellus with C. tschudii (mean K2P distance = 3.2 %); best trees had 609 steps (CI = 0.796; Bremer support Index (SI) = 28), and a -Ln = 4419.52, with 100 % and 97 % bootstrap support respectively. This clade, supported by three substitutions and 96 % bootstrap, is also obtained in the cladistic analysis of corresponding amino acids. When the C. aperea node was forced to join C. porcellus, these trees were consistently longer, less likely and robust, and with less defining characters than the optimal one. All C. porcellus sequences also clustered in a node defined by 15 substitutions. The sub-node containing animals from city markets, pet shops and laboratories was characterized by four substitutions (one non-silent, SI = 7, and 91 % bootstrap). Some South American C. porcellus, called "criollos" (creoles) by local breeders, were more diverse. Probably, a particular clade from southern Peru and Chile may represent a pre-Columbian lineage. Mean K2P distance between C. tschudii and C. aperea was rather large, 7.7 %. Cavia appeared as a robust node (100 % bootstrap). These results indicate that C. tschudii is the species most closely related to C. porcellus.},

Exotic plants deliberately and inadvertently introduced are threats to the natural vegetation. We review the introduced and/or adventitious flora of the archipelago in this paper. We report 21 recent arrivals, eight earlier introductions from the mid-1700s to the 1900s that have not been recognized before in the flora, six misidentified taxa, and five taxa present earlier but now reported from another island, resulting in a total of 227 introduced and naturalized species. Each species is discussed briefly with its native distribution, uses, first arrival in Chile and/or the archipelago, and comments on conservation impact. Identities of some previously cited taxa are clarified (e.g., Cupressus macrocarpa appears to be a misidentification for two other species of the same genus). Other noxious weeds known worldwide have recently been deliberately introduced, especially as garden ornamentals. Two of the most serious potential pests are the bird-dispersed Lantana camara and Lonicera japonica. We recommend immediate eradication of these two taxa and restriction on reintroduction. A conservation program emphasizing strong physical and biological methods is urgently needed to control the introduced species.},

	abstract = {The freshwater fish communities present degrees of resistance and resilience to human activities, which have a positive relationship with species diversity, and a negative relation with levels of previous intervention. The costal rivers in the Central-Southern zone of Chile are characterized by a diverse icthyofauna, principally in the low zones. Particularly, the potamon areas of the Andalién and Nonguén rivers, both running through the city of Concepción, have a high conservation value of biodiversity. In these areas, the reoccurring flooding in residential zones constructed over the floodplain has caused both channels to be dredged and semi-canalized. The fish community's response to this type of interventions has not been studied yet in Chile. We propose, given its high diversity and low level of previous intervention, that the fish community of the Andalién and Nonguén rivers is resilient to the effects of the dredge. To understand the community response in both rivers, we first analyzed the changes in the structure in situations before the dredge, with dredge actions, as well as after the dredge. Second, we analyzed the species-specific response to explain the community changes and be able to understand the sensibility of the different species to this intervention. Immediately after the dredge, a decrease of the species diversity occurred, generating the dominance of a single species, Cheirodon galusdae. Later, a partial recovery of the community parameters was noted. Based on species-specific responses of this type of perturbation, we identified 3 resistant species, 3 resilient species and 8 sensitive species. Among these last species, Nematogenys inermis has the highest relevance in conservation terms.},

However, the small farmers are excluded of the possibility to export their flowers as well as to obtain better prices, due to the precarious conditions in which they store and also the lack of knowledge of postharvest alternatives for each floral species. In this way, it becomes necessary to study new production alternatives in those that combine flowers with a good postharvest treatment according to the economical conditions of the small farmers. In relation to the contribution of this research, it was carried out an experiment which evaluated the behavior of Lisianthus (Eustoma grandiflorum R.) provinding storage conditions (12 °C; 85% H.R.) by using seven treatments, in which the products were applied in preharvest (Como®) and also citric acid applied in postharvest. In all of them there were evaluated four parameters of quality: Number of open flowers, number of flowers senecens, diameter of the button and weight of the button. The treatment T4 that corresponded to the application of Como® in preharvest, with a concentration of 1 cc/L, plus 0,5 mL of citric acid/L of water in postharvest, exhibited positive effects in the shelf life of Lisianthus, optimizing the diameter of the floral button and its weight.},

	abstract = {A root-knot nematode parasitising kiwi fruit (Actinidia deliciosa) in Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil and grape-vine (Vitis vinifera) in Chile, is identified as Meloidogyne ethiopica Whitehead, 1968. The species is redescribed from this new material and compared with the type description of M. ethiopica and another population of the species from Kenya. The female has an oval to squarish perineal pattern with a moderately high to high dorsal arch, smooth, widely spaced striae, and no 'shoulders'. The head region is set off with an elevated squarish labial disc, usually marked by annulations, and the stylet is 12-15 μm long, the cone usually being slightly curved dorsally and the shaft gradually widening posteriorly to near the junction with the rounded stylet knobs. The DGO is 3.0-5.0 μm behind the knobs. The male has a high, rounded head cap which is continuous with the body contour and has a distinct labial disc, almost circular to hexagonal in shape, and distinctly separated from the medial lips. The stylet is robust, 23-27 μm long with a straight cone and a cylindrical shaft widening slightly near its junction with the basal knobs which are smooth, round to pear-shaped and backwardly sloping. The stylet length of the second-stage juvenile is 11-14 μm, the DGO is 2.0-3.0 μm behind the knobs and the tail length is 52-72 μm. Biochemically, the esterase phenotype E3 (= Ki3) is species-specific and is the most useful character for differentiating M. ethiopica from other species. Reproduction is by mitotic parthenogenesis, 2n = 36-38. In a differential host test, populations of M. ethiopica reproduced on tomato, tobacco, pepper and watermelon. No reproduction occurred on cotton or peanut. Using the PCR-RAPD analysis to compare populations from Brazil, Chile and Kenya, a low proportion of polymorphic fragments (about 17.7%) was detected and the isolates clustered together with high bootstrap support (100%), thus confirming that all three populations are very similar and apparently conspecific.},

During the 2006-2007 growing season, blueberry production increased in Chile as a result of an expansion of the planted area, reaching around 10,762 ha in 2007. Fungal diseases are of great importance in blueberry production; among them, Phytophthora root rot is a disease known worldwide as a major cause of death for highbush blueberry plants in the USA. Symptoms of Phytophthora root rot have been detected over the last four years in Chile. Nevertheless, the causal agents have not been previously described in Chile. This study aims to determine the pathogenicity of Phytophthora spp. isolated from highbush blueberry and to study cultivar susceptibility. The pathogenicity tests show that the species P. cinnamomi and P. citrophthora were the cause of crown and root rot of highbush blueberry. Significant differences in plant height, shoot growth stem diameter, and fresh weights of roots and aerial parts between inoculated and non-inoculated plants were observed. Blueberry cv. 'Toro' was the only cultivar resistant to P. cinnamomi, while both 'Elliot' and 'Toro' were resistant to P. citrophthora. Regardless of the Phytophthora species, cv. 'Biloxi' was the most affected. This is the first report of Phytophthora root rot in Chile and, to our knowledge, the first report of P. citrophthora affecting blueberry plants worldwide.},

In accessions CS219 (C. annuum) and CS376 (C.frutescens), the color, as measured by Hue angle or H*, changed from green (H*=104°) to yellow (H *=79°) or orange (H*=57°), respectively, and was useful as a maturity index. CS32 (C. annuum) accession remained purple (H*=29°) during development. Its maximum color change was concomitant with an accumulation of citric acid, capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin, and relatively little changes in pH, soluble solids and acidity. All the accessions were susceptible to chilling injury (pitting, water soaked areas) at 5°C. Commercial shelf-life periods (as evaluated by shriveling after storage at 5°C plus 3 d of shelf life at 20°C and 75% R.H.) were two weeks in CS49 and CS376, more than 3 weeks for CS219, and less than 1 week for accession CS32.},

	abstract = {One hundred and ninety five specimens of free tailed bat (Tadarida brasiliensis) obtained from two regions of Chile were analized to determine parasite infection. From those specimens the endoparasites identified were: Trematoda: Acanthatrium lunatum, Limatuoides limatulus and Paralecithodendrium carlsbadensis; Cestoda: Vampirolepis sp.; Nematoda: Nochtia pilosus and Anoplostrongylus paradoxus. The ectoparasites identified were Chiroptonyssus robustipes, Ewingnana inaequalis and Notoedres lasionycteris all of them are acari species. Even thought the bat specimens are from the same species on both survey sites, the results differ for each site when the parasite species identified are compared. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},
